Everything was well explained and the assessment is easy to navigate. This is so important during an already stressful time. This site came recommended to me by a friend who has used your services and I will recommend you too.
I feel that the process was thorough and I feel confident that this service is official and will be accepted by my airline.
this service is very fast and convenient and would recommend it to others.
Great service! Very simplistic and the explanations were very understandable.
An absolutely wonderful experience. Dr. Moss and the rest of the staff was thorough approachable from the deepest part of my heart.
Very satisfied with the customer serviceproducts and service! Highly recommend.  Easy process
Thank you for making this so easy. I don't know what I would do without my girl.
So far it's been excellent. I just hope I'm approved and able to take my friend Bandit with me
This was quick and easy! Love the easy layout of the website great information
It was very fast the questions were upfront and the price was reasonable.
Very quick.  Confident that good service continues throughout the process.
Quick and easy processing. Just have to wait for the landlord approval now...
I completed my form on a Saturday afternoon with a rush order. I received my letter within twelve hours
Obviously I can't review the service properly just yet but I appreciate how easy they made the application process.
I'm so happy that I am not paying an arm and a leg for this. This actually costs me less than making a doctor appointment for this because I do not have insurance.
The application process was straight forward. The letter came fast. The follow up was good. I'd use them again.
Easy to use.  Great program too!  Card stock letter is not worth it.  I could have printed that myself on stock paper using the PDF I got for free.
Very easy to fill out not many questions and not bad of a price.
"These Folks are GREAT! They are an absolute Godsend. EZ to fill out forms and absolutely insane response time. Our HOA was threatening my wife and myself over our dogs to the point where it was affecting our health. I truly feel that getesa.com has kept our HOA from literally killing us. Obviously, I can't thank them enough. If you're in the same situation, stop reading this, quit worrying,  and submit your application already! You won't be sorry."
As a direct response digital advertising expert and customer would have sold me faster and sooner. =)
So far so good. Will see if the expedited process works as offered and paid for.
Very quick and convenient.  All information needed was easily accessible and useful.
So far so good. I thought it was going to be more stressful. I got my letter and is all messed up like it went through a storm to get here but other than that everything  about the experience was perfect. I do have the PDF file so I will use that and hopefully it will be fine.
I received my letter in less than 24 hours. I was in a rush because my family physician was unable to write one for me and I was moving in less than a week. I'm so happy I found this website!!!! I'll be recommending this site to my friends.
thank you for making this so simple and easy. It is very stress free and gives me a lot of relief
Very fast service and legit letter from a doc. Very happy with overall service!
Quick and easy to use of all the websites this offers the best service and quality.
Quick and easy-- my documents look great! Would absolutely purchase again.
Great site. Nice to know I will be able to have my ESA by my side and have my rights to do so protected.
Well it was difficult to write why I felt I needed this type of support.  I'd never written it all down and it was very heavy.
It was easy and quick. A licensed doctor contacted me very quickly and I received my letter soon after. The letter is legitimate. It was a bit pricey but worth it if you're serious about having a support animal.
Easy and quick to do as well as making me feel safe about my information
I found this site - hoping that it helps with apt searches in Cali as so many are not pet friendly or charge large fees for cats monthly and deposits.
The whole process was fast and stress free. I had my results and letter via email less then 12 hours.
Very clear
I have high hopes that I will receive help and have felt much better knowing there was some place to turn to.  The directions and site were easy to follow.
The website is super easy to navigate and the forms were easy to fill out.
Very quick and easy to order! Now I'll just have to wait and see if it pans out.
Not only was the experience easily accomplished but it's for a great cause. I'm satisfied with the work ESA has done
I liked how easy it was to be so personable over the web I have trouble socializing in person doing over the web made it more easy to open up.
Good when I felt overwhelmed and could not complete. Getting back to complete was easy thank you
This site was easy to navigate and very straight forward. I appreciate the effort put into making this process less stressful.
I just submitted my request. If all goes well this was a very smooth transition.
So easy and quick.  Then I had a slight issue which was my mistake
Very easy and simple process. I can't believe how quickly they responded to my inquiries. I recieved all my documents with in 24 hrs and When I submitted my reasonable accommodation form it was filled out and returned to me in like 6 hours.  This service is amazing and all letters are very well written by Licensed mental health clinicians with their license numbers and contact info in the documents. Rest assured you have found the right solution for your best friends needs. No more dealing with No pet or breed restrictions polices for me.   Thank you Get ESA
The service seems accredited and meets all requirements the airline has requested. Easy form to fill out and reasonable priced.
The patches are too big for the harness and the rough velcro of the patch extends over onto the dog's skin on both sides of the harness. The sizes also run large. I bought a large and wish I had bought a medium.
Just placed my order.  Hopefully everything will be ok. Customer service is very good.
Please ship it fast I am traveling soon and need it I am praying I get it. Before the 12th please pretty please !!! Thank You I will review as the best!!!
Very easy and effective. Also doctor emails you personally and promptly if you have any questions which is great!
I had a little trouble submitting the form. When I clicked next nothing happened on my iPad and on my lap top.  I was finally able to place my order from my phone. Everything else was wonderful. Excellent customer service
Simple & straightforward. Lookin forward to being able to welcome a new furry family  member soon!
Easy and reasonably priced but I was a bit confused about what letter I needed.
Fast easy -unsure the time I would receive my letter...I need it by 8/11/2017-pray that I'll get it emailed to me ASAP
Over a year ago I thought I rescued Winnie the Cat.  It turns out she really did the rescuing. Thank you for offering a way to prove that pets provide the utmost support in our lives.  My experience with getesa.com has been seamless.
The application process is simple and gives you an opportunity to explain your unique circumstance.
Application was easy to follow. Results to be determined when received/used.
Very prompt. Will see if it is accepted when I receive hard copy. My last name on the document misspelled!!! I sent a reply back and hope it will be corrected or I can not use the letter.
Was quick and easy. I got the letter in an email the very next day! I couldn't believe it. Leasing office accepted it with no questions or concerns! If you're looking into other websites chose this one! Trust me!
I am so pleased with the professionalism and expertise that I received. The personal follow up and quick answers to my many questions. As a result my beloved Big Foot & I are traveling without any problems on a very short notice. I'm eternally grateful they have made my relocation to Europe so much easier.
As long as this isn't a scam I will be very please with these services. Very quick and easy! Thank you!
Awesome support service center great deal everything you need. Absolutely satisfied.
Just went through the purchase.  Not sure what will happen; but so far so good.
I might follow back up and obtain a Reasonable Accommodation Form if needed. Thank you so much for the quick turn around after my personal local therapist left me in the lurch.
Very smooth and easy!  The Dr preparing the forms was very empathic and helpful to my needs and questions.  I would be pleased to recommend to anyone that needs these services!
this is really weird because i feel like im looking for for help then just shopping for an ideam?
"Vest arrived with title of  ""Service Dog"" on the side but Roscoe is an emotional support dog.  I don't want to falsify his title.  Do I need Emotional support name tag on the vest?"
Filling out the form was quick and easy.  I like that you can register more than one pet at a time rather than paying to register each pet individually.
The process to get my dog his ESA cert was fast and easy! I had the documents in less than a day.
I had an easy shopping experience and look forward to getting my letter and getting more products in the future
The site is very easy to navigate and the questions felt that they would give the doctor enough information to understand why having an ESD for our pet is necessary.
Was absolutely amazed at the speed and responsiveness of the Dr and her adaptability to our needs.  She customized the letters she provided to exactly what we needed for our daughter and Chinchilla.  It's taken a weight off her shoulders as she prepares for college and is now approved by her school to move in her ESA.  Thank you!
Hopefully this will be good for Jet Blue who has been very vicious in the past even when my medical doctor gave me a letter. I cannot really comment on how the letter and pass work until I have to fly so I will update you once that occurs
Great Experience!! My ESA letter was provided in a timely manner as mentioned and requested.
Great service. Smooth quick and straight forward. In depth but not invasive.
so far so good. lets see how things go in the future.  That's what it was when I got it.  I have now received everything and couldn't be happier.
I really appreciate that you go above and beyond for campus housing since I'm a PhD candidate
It was very quick and easy to use. When my apartment prompted for more information i was able to get what I needed just from sending and email. I would highly recommend
So far the process has been simple and reassuring.  But I have not received the ESA letter yet or confirmed that Jet Blue will accept it so I am reserving final accolades until the process is complete!
The forms and questions seem like they were written by someone who cares.
I appreciate my information being private and that this site follows  HIPAA regulations
Satisfied so far. Supplied to current place that we are going to be renting soon.
Very easy I received my letter via email within a couple of hours. It's legit and I am pleased and very satisfied!
great so far a little computer glitch on another order but it's working out fine with great support
