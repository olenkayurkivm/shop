Everything is  good and all of the work are very efficient. I trust your staff and save me a lot of time. I am very grateful.
The process has been simple and straightforward. I chose your service over others because you offer the option to complete the form my landlord requires rather than only providing a generic letter for a higher cost.
Every step is very detailed and very good. The contents of the form are considered very thoughtful.
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.  I feel supported when I am with my dog.  It DOES make a difference in my life to be able to have him with me at stressful times.
Quick responses and easy to to fill out. I appreciate the great customer service!
Very good and would highly recommend! They are caring and very responsive when you need any questions answered.
It was easy to fill out and would definitely recommend this to any who need emotional support animals certified.
This is my third year of experience with your organization. It has always been exemplary service. Thank you
I received the letter perfectly written to the airline's standards & I received an ID card in the mail. Everything looks great - now I just hope there's no issues with actually using everything!
Very thorough. Stressful for me to do with little tech knowledge they made it very simple. Also very prompt evaluation. Professional sight.
It was very efficient so far as long as the rest goes through as planned
Straight forward questions delivered conveniently helped to expedite the ESA support authorization processing
Hopefully I'll get the letter in time for my flight. I confident all will go as planned
quick and easy ! Customer support was super kind and helped me with my problem right away!
kind of expensive. airline forms should be included. and id shouldn't be more than 15$ extra without shipment tracking
Everything was laid out and easy to use. I like that I don't have to physically speak to anyone this flairs my social anxiety. Thank you for making this easy.
Thank you for making it simple I had been getting letters from my regular therapist but since I lost health care coverage trying to get back in the system to have it renewed has been a struggle. I appreciate the professionalism with which you conduct this lifesaving service.
It was an easy process I just wish there were more characters in the paragraph where you explain your situation/need.  I ran out of room to give all the information I felt was important.
my calls were returned and all my questions were answered in a very timely manner and person that called me back was extremely courteous and willing to help.
The whole process is very smooth and convenient the web is safe and stable.
Very nice site and very intuitive. The questions were clear and I had no problems answering anything. Thank you for providing this much-needed service.
Easy navigation. Fast and timely  customer service. Professional service as well.
It probably is too soon to decide since I just submitted my application but so far I am very satisfied.
You guys are the reason that I was able to move away from home and continue my education.
Thanks for the wonderful service.  Molly and I appreciate it very much.
His has been a stress relief and Iâ€™m hoping to get my certificate for my Clyde
I loved how their service is. My dog was approved and he has been able to with us without ay problems and it makes me so happy having  him always with me. Thank you!!
I typed and typed all kinds of information into the form on my iPad but when I went to browse for a picture to attach to the form all my information was gone. I tried a second time and same thing happened. The 3rd time I went to my PC. I was able to get it to hold my info but  it would not download the picture to the site Frustrating.
