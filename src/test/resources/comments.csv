I was incredibly impressed by the professionalism and prompt attention from getesa.com.  I had a question and emailed them and quickly received a response.  I recommend them highly.
Great fast and reliable! Website answered all my questions that I was looking for. Information was very informative. They wrote a letter for my landlord with all pertinent information that needed to be included. Would highly recommend this company.
I honestly was a little worried but call it one of my many anxieties. I completed everything at 11:00pm and by 3:30 am I had a well written letter with a certified therapist. I even checked to see if the person was legitimately certified. I am very glad to have people putting their time and effort into this and helping people like me who depend on their animal for support. Thank you so much.
I received my letter the same day I sent my information they were very fast and very helpful. I've been looking for reliable websites but they all seem to be scams honest
Everything was great! Needed a letter to keep my dog in my apartment. I couldn't get into a psychiatrist because it takes weeks. I got my letter in a matter of hours! Thank you so much for helping me keep my fur babies. Will definitely be renewing through them!!
Fantastic customer service excellent communication
It was 100 bucks for the letter but I got 10% off with a coupon code!! So pleased with my letter it is very professional and written by a true psychologist. Bought and sent within hours! So quick and very easy! So glad I used this service thank you very much!
Everything happened so quickly! I was approved and the letter was emailed to me a few hours later. Thank you!
Best customer service! They get back to you quickly no matter what time of day it is. They helped my family get our ESA letter quickly when times turned. Customer service responded to all my questions promptly. Price is just right which is also a plus!
"So professional, and easy to work with. I appreciate the concern and assistance! Thank you !"
This was so simple and stress free! I would recommend this site to anyone who requires documents for their sweet animals. My request was approved within 12 hours. I will be so calm and Happy with Dougie at my side.
