the experience has been great. can't complain I have been happy since I started
Thank you for making it easy to explain my situation. I would never have been able to speak to someone in person and tell them everything.
It was so helpful and detailed I explained myself and I love how you guys care to ask for details of how they help me with my daily activities.
your website is really good and I found all the answers to the questions that I needed. Good experience
Thank you! I have been suffering from depression and am thankful for the help in getting my dog a ESA letter
Very fast and easy. Now i just need to wait and see if i qualify and if the form will suffice for my landlord to allow me to get a pet.
I received my official letter very quick. It was accepted by the apartment and now I am waited to get the Reasonable Accommodation form completed to move forward.
Please rush my order I fly in the morning and just realized my previous let has expired!!
Site has been very easy to manage.  They are reputable and easily refunded my money when I accidentally did a duplicate request. Very responsive
Simple and straight to the point. I loved that it didn't MAKE me get housing and travel together like a bunch of other sites.
Thus far my experience was great. Charge was $99 as listed. I just hope the rest of the process is as smooth.
Read a reviews and bbb reviews and feel confident. Will post more after completion.
The process was an easy one and I would  suggest this site to others in need such as me.
There is no phone  number on your website and i requested a call and someone actually called. That is wonderful
The initial form is very straightforward and easy to use as well as the checkout process. I suppose my overall satisfaction with the process is if my cats are approved as ESAs
The ordering portion of this service was very user-friendly and easy to navigate. I felt all the questions were pertinent to a proper diagnosis therefore
It was easy to understand and seems to be a good place to register your emotional support animal
It went smooth I didn't receive the original copy in the mail just the email copy
As long as your company fulfills its obligation; This was exactly the service and product I was searching for.
user friendly website I'm really impressed with how quickly they respond to questions via email.
It was easy and I liked that I was able to come back and  finish at later date. I am also dual state and they were able to accomated
Please stop sending renewal texts in the middle of the night that frighten both me and my companion animals!
Thank you for the quick response. Doctor responds quickly and efficiently. Prices are reasonable. Overall GREAT service and knowledge.
Thank you so much for this opportunity. You have no idea how much this will help me
I'll be extremely satisfied if I can obtain the paperwork faster than 5hrs
Their service was unbelievably fast and accurate. I never expected my letter so quickly and it really alleviated so much stress from having my animal with me in my apartment. I would recommend this service and I hope to use them again.
Fast response time support over the weekend very decent pricing for services rendered
Get Esa is a good service to work with. This is the 2nd year in a row that I have been using their services. They are efficient and customer oriented. There have been no problems using the paperwork that they supply.
i really am happy that there is a service like this for people like me its a little pricey... but its all worth it for me in the end
My experience has gone very smoothly. I very much appreciate the articles about finding legitimate esa registration on the site... Very helpful!
Everything was super easy to get through and self-explanatory love this website!
