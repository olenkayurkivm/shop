user friendly and it was easy. I would recommend you to my lease clients who have pets......since I am a realtor...
Thank you for all your prompt and effective service. Allegiant Air said that our Emotional support evaluation letter was perfect. Our Cairn terrier Seamus was treated very nicely and even served a cup of ice. It would have been very unpleasant to have traveled without him.
Professional letter with documentation which supports the necessity and  immeasurable value my pet provides to the quality of my daily life
very easy to fill out and this will allow me to move forward with the safety of my dog by my side.
I need your assistance flying out tomorrow @ 5pm. Thanks. My dog helps me a lot.
Navigating the website finding what I need easy and quick. Let's see how the rest of the process goes after my evaluation.
Seems good so far. We'll see if my landlord accepts the letter. I thought the exam was a little short? It took less than 10 minutes so that seems a bit odd to really be able to determine if someone really needs an ESA. Hopefully all works out well!
Very simple to navigate site and explain necessity for letter. Waiting on doctor to send letter
Excellent site I really hope this works with getting my animal certified.
I received my letter and ID cards quickly and everyone was so helpful! Thank you!
Easy and quick. You could include however
Thanks for making the process quick and easy and not to personal that was truly appreciated.
I am excited to keep my dog with me after 17 years I thought I had to part with him but because of you guys I get to keep him.
...glad I found your ESA Service.. Communications with client are very Professional...
Just ordered really simple. Hoping this is the help I need. Thank you.
"Great service this a plus  I went to the property manager office and as soon i gave her the letter they did not charge me for the dog and everything went great thanks a lot. very satisfied with getesa.com
VERY EASY THANK YOU.  IF I DO NOT GET DR. APPROVAL
Could not have been happier with the decision to do this. As a college student I'm under a lot of stress constantly and being able to have my cat at my apartment is a great comfort and highly therapeutic - if it weren't for ESA
The purchasing process was simple and very streamlined.  I liked the options to tailor the letters to different airlines.  No other letter service offered that.
I would say so far 5 stars although the transaction just happened so we shall see.
Great service! The letter was extremely professional and direct. Written by a psychologist who was easy to google and verify she has her own website.  I can keep my dog now!
This was super simple and uses the exact same evaluation questions as my doctors
Easy I would like to receive the Hawaiian airlines flt authorization paperwork as well.
So far so good.  It was amazingly simple to complete the form and submit it for review.  As long as the therapist reviews it and the authorization letter gets done in 48 hours I'll be one happy camper!  Thank you so much!
Robert the representative I spoke with but he assured me that the doctors handle the information very professionally and seriously. He made it feel like the text box was talking to a person
The website is very easy to use. I got my letter and card fast the landlord didn't have any issues letting me and my dog stay after showing her the letter.
I couldn't be more thankful for my ESA letter. GetEsa asked direct questions and took my answers into account. It's not some computer generated response it's an actual doctor who listened to what I had to say. Seriously
Fast and easy the doctor was great! Fast response and promptness to my questions and needs!
thank you so much for all your help in getting me a dog to help me cope
Quick and easy process! Now I don't have to worry about relocating or re-homing my pet.
I had technical problems with the assessment form on the website at first but the issue was resolved. I was personally emailed by Dr. Lisa Isaac and I got everything I needed electronically and by mail.
The process so far was quick and simple hopefully the delivery process is just as quick!
Extremely simple and straightforward. I would definitely recommend again
Completing the form helped me realize how much I depend on the pets and how important it is for companion animals to be with their owners
The website was easy to use and they were quick to respond.  I received my letter in a few days. This is going to make flying with my little dog so much easier.  Thank you.
So thankful to have my companion travel alongside with me. Thank you so much!
Quick and easy very responsive to emailed questions in a timely manor.
This service is great and truly helped me and my cat stay living together for less than an expensive pet fee for my rental home..the landlord approved the letter. I can't thank yall enough for the service. Thank you thank you!!
So far this seems like an easy and non-invasive way to get a medical professional to help me with the ESA prescription. It's not unlike going to a different pharmacy or other service when I need something that my doctor cannot provide. I'm hoping I am able to get my dog qualified as an ESA immediately. He is in Therapy Dog training and we would like to pursue Service Dog training as well.
I just purchased  ESA  letters for my 2 dogs. I will let you know how it goes....I have received the letters and the id cards I haven't used them yet but it has given me peace of mind for the future. the process was easy and the cost compared to other sites was very good.
You have made it very easy for me which makes me feel more at easy. It is really nice knowing there are people our there like you to help.
I appreciate people like you who have found a way to provide services that consumers really need at fair prices. Thank you so much. You don't know how great an impact you've had on my life.
So far so good. I received a timely response to a question I had. Very easy to use this site compared to others.
It was so painless to do and very to the point. I would highly recommended this for people that are needing an emotional support animal.
Received a very fast response time! Your website is easy to use and your prices are fair. Thanks
I just submitted the form if my request is accepted I will be very satisfied and will definitely recommend this site to others.
This is before I receive the product  I hope I as good as the service!
So far so good I can't be 100% without having used my ESA letter. However
Just want to say this was so easy and I'm on my way to being a happier pet parant ! Thank you
"Quick and easy; I appreciate the fact that it is a 7 days a week, 365 days a year service."
very easy steps, fast delivery and very helpful answering my questions. Thank you so much!
It was very self explanatory the site was easy to navigate and the manual exam was very thorough about what your disorders and symptoms where like. Overall a very great and helpful site.
Like that you have option for multiple pets as well as expedited option .
So far so good. Just waiting for letter to come via email
I was skeptical because some websites claim to be authentic but can land you in serious legal troubles if they turn out to be a fraud. This one is authentic thankfully. The best part is the price you get registration AND the letter which is almost a hundred dollars more in total anywhere else as most MDs will charge for the letter. I selected rushed service and I was approved within two hours. Would recommend.,,,,,
So far no complaints. I like the sounds of this company and what it offers.
I am waiting for this to go through. Only then will it be logical to write a proper critique.
Everything so far has gone smoothly. I would  order products from them again.
Thank you so much for your fast assistance. I was extremely stressed and anxious about not having my dog with me when I move and travel and your service has really lifted a huge burden.
I will reassess services once I have completed the process and receive my EMS letters
So far everything is great still havent been approved and hope a quick letter is issued.
The website made it easy to complete the appropriate forms. I have not completed the process yet so I cannot comment on how quick the response is.
it seems to be a really smooth process. looking forward to receiving the letter in my inbox.
Everyone was superb.  The ID did not arrive in time for travel.  Instead Robert provided a copy for printing.  That worked.
This website was extremely easy and helpful and also gave a great amount of information that I needed!
I am very satisfied with how easy and inexpensive this process was and they got back to me very quickly. Overall experience was excellent I definitely recommend this site!
very easy and quick! I needed additional paperwork for my landlord and the doctor had everything done for me so quick. I reached out to the customer service number and they were so kind and helpful with all my questions and concerns. I highly recommend.
I found the questions to be very thought-provoking and thorough. I hope that this service works well and provides me the emotional support animal that I'm looking for.
I felt it was a thorough evaluation and I'm pleased  with the professionalism of the website. It was also a quick and easy experience.
excellent and very quick reply. The approval letter satisfied requirements for HOA.
Everything has been so simple so far I am a little skeptical and would like to follow up with someone after receiving the product!
Than you so very much for making the process pain free and quick. I am so happy to be able to keep my little guy by my side - right where I need him to be.
I don't have the response yet but the form is very accurate in detailing why it is you need your pet
Easy process...had contacted customer service for questions prior and did research.  Seems legitimate!
It's been great so far.  I am very excited to move forward in this process.
This workflow was easy and professional. I used to work in mental health and these were accurate verification questions
Quick and easy! I like the all-in-one option where you can get the ESA travel and housing letters together.
Get Esa was recommended by a friend and I recieved exceptionally  friendly support from all the staff very quick to return emails with my concerns or questions
very easy and this helped me tremendously. This has been a life saver for me. Took a big burden of worry off my shoulders.
So far the experience has been great hoping for a great ending as well.
if is as easy as this and receive my request many more people will be shopping... many
This is an amazing site. I feel that they truly care for you and your needs. Customer support is always readily available for any out of the blue needs. I would highly recommend this site to anyone with actual need for an ESA!
Easy forms with detailed instructions/explanations. Fast and accurate information contained in the reports. They stand behind their word.
Good so far! Hope my letter comes quickly and is accepted by my university!
I was afraid I would feel silly expressing my anxiety but doing it in writing made the experience less daunting.
so grateful to find this site! The doctors truly care and want to help you. I had further questions and emailed the doctor and she emailed back within a day and was so sweet! I will recommend to everyone!
So far it's been easy I usually get it from my Dr. However she's not available to me right now
Everything was efficient and I received my letter in less than 24 hours after the evaluation.
Thank you for your service and help this is such a blessing to have your help with all of this.
The form was easy to fill out and the website is very user friendly as it should be.
My friend Julia Cooper she purchased it for me.  Thank you for making our lives simpler.
Extremely simple. I loved the process and feel like I received everything I needed with ease.
The system is easy to use. It will be a couple days till I know how the rest of this company works. But so far I have loved it.
"So far so good.  Just applied hopefully all goes well
Update: got my letter very quick!"
Very easy to complete details to determine qualification.  I have not taken my trip yet but have submitted the documents to the airline.  More to follow.
I  had to use adifferent computer to execute the order....otherwise a good experience
Wonder quick and easy recommending to friends who struggle with the same problem with their apartments not letting them have ESA pets
Don't know yet.  May be ok.  We'll see if the apartment complex allows it.
I youth it was very easy and gave the correct information needed to order
So far so good but I would like to finish out the process and see how it works
Simple price was right and just amazing. This will help my husband and his brain injury so much
Easy to use. I feel better already knowing my emotional support animal will be able to accompany me.
Process was quick and simple and I was about to receive my letter and identification card in the mail in a week's time. Couldn't ask for more.
Easy to navigate easy to submit
"My ratings only apply to the ""shopping experience"".  This is not an endorsement of the final product.  Time will tell. As a follow-up to my first response, my information was treated with respect, honesty, the product provided was delivered quickly and as advertised.  I recommend."
Application process was easy & price was reasonable compared to other providers. Received the letter same day via email and hardcopy arrived 2 days later. I verified the license of my therapist as well to make sure it was legitimate. I would highly recommend.
This was fast and easy. Avoided me a visit to my psychiatrist. The fees and wait times to see most specialty physicians are ridiculous.
THANK YOU!!! tHIS IS SO IMPORTANT.  i KNOW PEOPLE SCAM ALL THE TIME BUT YOU HAVE HELPED US WHO REALLY NEED THIS.
So far great exalt customer service  have not gotten a response yet great service
So far the website was very easy to use. I am looking forward to hearing back from the doctor and receiving the necessary documents for my pet.
I won't know until the experience is over. It worked just perfect. Thank you
GetEsa.com was very helpful. They were the cheapest company and accommodated my needs for four pets. They responded to inquiries very quickly and I got my letter the same day I applied for it. I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs an emotional support animal. I will be using them again when I need to update my letter.
So far got quick replies to questions.  All answers said this is a legal document.  Sent copy to Allegiant Air and they said: note is compliant to DOT regulation 14 CFR 382.117.   You will still need to present the note on the day of travel at the airport however
When messaging the online chat with questions they helped with every question I've had. Thank you so much !
Has been easy so far. Will have to wait until approved and receive ESA letter to really verify
I loved the experience. It was quick and easy and provided me with everything I needed!
Easy and professional. Fast delivery via email. Town around was less than 24 hours.
The process seemed easy.  I would like a follow up to let you know how it all went.
I hope this will help me find an apartment who will let us stay together.
So easy and concise...and seemingly kinder than other companies offering the same service.
Haven't received the letter yet but the process seemed to have more substance than other similar websites. Pricing was as fair or less than most websites.
The gentleman on the phone was very patient friendly and helpful.  Please call me to receive pymt asap. Thank you!
I found the whole process easy and painless.  Directions were very clear and easy to follow.  I am so grateful for this website!!!
Easy process to go through love the option to receive letter through email.
By far this was the best  website very professional very helpful the process was extremely easy and fast
So the process has been pretty easy. If everything turns out the way I hope well I will be very happy with the site.
Process was straight forward.  I look forward to receiving status. Thanks
The website was so easy to navigate and the questionnaire was very straight-forward. I will be back if I ever need further documentation.
User friendly format. Great friendly staff to assist me by phone for questions. I really like the aspect of free yearly renewals. This is the only place that offers that service! I have already recommended this place to my niece. It arrived really fast! Love this place!
Went well only issue is I can't see the photo I uploaded and Im concerned it didn't  work
Customer Care Associates pleasant to work with very helpful in answering questions and concerns. Emails quickly answered.
Customer Service associates are awesome great communication on the phone and via email.
Excellent Customer Service! Very friendly staff and extremely helpful! Recommend 100%!
So far I am pleased. Looking forward to hearing back from the Psychologist.
So far my shopping experience has been SO AMAZING. The customer service was the best I have EVER had. The reps were so nice and so eager to help me. They did not seem annoyed or bothered by my 100 questions. I will definetley recommend this site to everyone I know!
So far so good! Just waiting to see the letter...but the process was quick and easy.
So far so good. Easy form to fill out. GREAT questionnaire. I hope I get approved.
Fast and efficient.  Looking forward to receiving my documents in a timely manner.
Was wonderful. Very straightforward from the beginning. Super fast correspondence and very accommodating customer service. Purchased additional verification as my landlord needed papers filled out and was incredibly prompt with delivery. Great service for someone like me who couldn't get in to see my GP before moving.
I provided an invalid shipping address for ID cards and ESA letter I had ordered. The customer service response was incredibly fast and express shipped new copiesof my items to proper address at no additional cost to me. I was very pleased with the service I received here and will be using their services again in the future.
Thank you for providing a simple user-friendly way to register for ESA. Received letter from doctor in 24hours. Thank you getesa.com!!
Great experience! Product just as promised... Extremely friendly and helpful customer service. Would gladly recommend highly.
Relatively straightforward questions and informative website.  Thank you.
It was pretty simple and fast to do the online questionnaire.  The customer service answers any question you have in a timely manner.
The service was great! I ordered the expidited ESA letter and received it very quickly. My landlord is very difficult and called the doctor to verify. They have done a great job verifying for them and keeping me informed throughout the process. Great job! Couldn't be more satisfied.
The process is very simple and I'm very excited to receive my letter and ID card and be able to keep my best friend!
FANTASTIC customer service absolutely phenomenal help.  I really appreciate the timely responses and kindness I've been shown.
So far no complaints the final test will be if this letter solves my problem at my apartment complex
Very quick service. The online chat feature helped me navigate the site.
Very easy to navigate. I am happy with my experience with Get Esa so for.
As long as my dog is able to fly with me I'll be totally happy with my purchase
Easy to work with thank you! I highly recommend this service for anyone who uses their animal(s) as emotional support.
I hope I did it correct!!! I didn't put my CC in yet! I hope it won't slow down the process!!!
Your staff is amazing!!! Thank you so much for your help!!! This is such a great site & sooo amazing for people that depend on their animals for emotional support!!!
So far so good! Emailed customer support about a question and they returned email within a couple of hours same night. Waiting for approval of ESA letter.
It was quick and easy. Had trouble with downloading photo so had to email it. Quick help with that as well!
If this letter gets my dog on the plane from Las Vegas to Des Moines I will be buying the rest of the packages you have to offer and I will recommend this site to everyone I know with a dog!
The process was quick and easy so far but I have not yet received my paperwork. The customer service support was very helpful with answering my questions. I still need to have my interview.
The survey questions mirrored those my doctor would ask about depression symptoms boosting my confidence in the process. It was quick and easy to get through.
I really appreciated the chat session and quick response of Brenda as my situation is unique
So far everything has been great! Now I'm just waiting for the letter and certificate!
My response was quick and concise. I even had to change an order detail and my physician helped with that in a timely fashion!
This process was very easy and I am 100% satisfied. When I needed to update my animals information it was handled with great care and experience. I would highly recommend getesa.com
Was so fast and the ESA letter is really perfect with all details that they need to know
Great! Paid for a rush fee and got my letter in 4 hours! Brought my fur baby home the next day :)
Fast and easy process and response was within the same day.  Glad to see this service provided without hassle and a lot of expense.
Very easy to follow instructions and timely response! I received everything I needed!
Excellent and easygreater than Great service fast the most important thing is there was a person to speak to, there was someone to talk to that assuaged my concerns. Very excellent. Beware of the others on the Internet.
"Great!!!! Everything from beginning to end was simply great, and completed in a very timely manner. The professional product was far more
Superior than any other I've tried. The buck stops with getesa.com. Thanks you from Robert"
My husband is a very stressed person and his comfort dog has an amazing way of keeping him calm. Thanks so much for your support
Worked great really simple and my appartments didn't have any issues so it was worth it.
This was wonderful and an eye opener as I filled out the medical questions. I suffer from panic attacks and having my ESA with me as I travel bus, is essential for me to get through the anxiety. And my husband suffers from claustrophobia, sometimes it isn't so great to get old. This is a valuable service to those of us who have trouble just getting to a Doctor. Thank you for your help!
The service was very fast. Listed time to hear something back was up to 72 hours. I was APPROVED in less than 5. I am so happy that my lovable companion cam stay with me anywhere. Thank you so much getesa.com.
So far it seems to be a reasonable process.   I will update when this process is over
I am very happy with the prompt service I received from getesa.com. I would highly recommend their service. Thank You
Was quick and easy I found this site to be much less than most the others online. The response time was very quick and I receive everything as described.
Easy to purchase.  Could say more if I already had it and had a chance to see how it works.
Very quick service and I even got to talk to a real person about whatever concerns I had regarding ny letter! I will be back to get an air travel letter in the future!
I called and got some clarification that helped me feel confident about using there services
My school won't accept my psychiatrist's letter because it wasn't specific enough. This service makes it quick and easy to get letter.
excellent so far. I just wish you also sold a vest along with the card and tags and letter.
clear questions easy process
This was a quick easy
Robert at extension 700 was friendly and very informative. Excellent customer service!
It was quick and easy! A thorough survey about my current doctor and health seemed to really understand how I feel daily and how an animal would help. The product is very generic but gets the job done I suppose.
Website is a slightly confusing. All of it is on one page instead of loading different pages so you have to scroll. Other than that the workflow was easy to follow.
I found the website very user friendly but I would recommend simply options for the certificate the ID card and the airline certificate descriptions etc
The photo I submitted did not upload after waiting over an hour.  I finally gave up and submitted without the upload!
Site a little difficult to navigate. Perhaps due to my using iPhone instead as my laptop isn’t working
It was nice and easy process. Very organize and really fast to complete.
This website is easy to navigate and understand. My experience was quick and I didn't have any problems.
If you guys can set up a customer account registration that will be much easier for future shopping
I was surprised I had to pay for an update to the pet information in an existing letter - needs to be clearer for future clients.
"I like the all in one form. However, I wish there was a seperate store page or bottom option section for additional items. Either additional items, collars, extra ID cards, etc... Or at least more specific item descriptions.
I was not sure if they ESA Letter was/is the same payment for the Doctor Eval of my submission or if it was just covering the amount of the certificate."
It was an easy process but it did take me a bit to find the cost on the web site
Very informative and easy to use. Quick save buttons along the way would help as I had to restart several times.
I found it a bit difficult at times especially watching the number of characters in a  comment without going over.
I wished there was a # I could speak to directly  since I have no idea which form is needed for housing
I hope I am not scammed because I am in severe need of a letter for my new apartment. Other than that I had no problem filling out the questionnaire.
As long as i get what i need to keep my dog with me then I will be happy.
I need to see if and when I get the letter.  It's been a little difficult to navigate through the system
Questions were easy to answer. I feel satisfied with with my experience.
I'm nervous that this is not a legitimate service.  Please be sure items are stamped showing that my dog is registered with recognized government ESA organization.  Thank you.
so far ok need to see final result and get my dog before full review can be even close to accurate.
My only criticism is more so probably error on my end. I kept on having to redo the entire form every time I was away or minimized it.
I would have liked it better if you were using encryption for security.  Your form is wide open security wise.  I was uncomfortable using my credit card.
I love the detailed questions and the BBB Rating! I have looked at other options and this seemed like the best fit for me.
Once I entered previous ID # most information should self populate and it does not.
has been easy to use and appears streamlined waiting on papers to determine turn around time.
I found the mailing option somewhat confusing.  It's shameful you charge extra to have the new Allegiant form filled out. Your charge was only $49 last year but this year it is $59 plus $10 form fee.
I couldn’t find any reputable counselors locally who didn’t want $1000+ or more to give me a letter and 3 months evaluation even with medical documentation to back up what I have so I did a google search and came upon this company to save me from having to find another home for Savannah and me.
I really appreciate how quickly ESA.com processes your request for you.
"Expeditious service and care coordination. However, I would like privacy. The label clearly states the nature of the package contents, and alludes to psychiatric care and intervention. That is a violation of privacy. My mail carrier should not know my personal health status or concerns. HIPAA.
Please exercise better discretion when sending these packages to patients. EPS on the label would suffice."
Reasonable quick and transparent. A lot of sites try to trick you which is highly annoying and makes me click off their site because I don't feel that I can trust them to not pull something shady with access to my credit information
This service is a godsend. My dog is my child and acts as a life saver due to my severe anxiety and depression. This helps me tremendously as it allows her to stay with me as I don't have health insurance and can't afford to see a doctor at the moment.
I am seriously having anxiety over using this sight even though it came highly recommended.  I pray this is not fake.  On the other-hand the process was very easy.
I called and left a message with regard to my inquiries. I received a call back the next day and a voicemail was left.  However he still answered my questions. I have completed step 1 of process. An instant text message went to my phone confirming order and informing me a doctor assigned to me will be reviewing exam soon
"It went pretty well, but I hope what I paid for will for sure give me free stays at hotels or motels on the road.  This is very important!"
"Self-explanatory questions, however some made you really dig deep. Overall, a really good experience."
So far it was easy but I cannot completely review until the form is sent and airline reviews for acceptability.
I am satisfied with my order at this point as long as I receive my letter for my cat
Simple questionnaire cheaper that the other sites I looked at. Option for only the housing letter was nice. My experience was good and now I have my kitties without worrying about fees or eviction!
I’m a little worried about being charged more then once because my form wouldn’t submit
Easy to use and understand. No rush feeling and the ability to save and go back to complete is very helpful.
Very good. Disappointed that you do not offer an instant online printable report. I am waiting to see how long it takes on your 6 to 12 hour turn around.
Experience was fine. Consider having clients create an online profile and use a portal where our doctors info ESA letters
I really appreciate your services although it took me more like an hour than 10 minutes to get the application filled out.
Its fast! Cheap! And great. It helps alot! I dont have to go out my way
Looking forward to JetBlue form filled out - and hopefully my mom will not have a problem travelling with support dog.
Informative and easy to use website.  Quick response and accommodating customer support.
The price was high but well worth it. I felt comfortable talking about my problem.
Easy and understanding of the true need for a ESA. I do wish since I selected need ASAP that it wasn't a 12 hour wait.
The GetESA website has a lot of great information is very easy to use.
I had issues submitting on the original site and customer service was very helpful in providing me an alternative solution.
More clarification on the process since payment is asked for prior to confirmation would be great! Customer service was able to answer my questions greatly appreciated!
The shopping experience was good for the price and I was able to get my letter soon. Thanks.
It’s a very helpful site.  All that was missing from the site was an application for an ESA housing letter.
This was a bit confusing trying to figure out what I needed in order to renew the ESA letter. I'm still unsure if I purchased the necessary documentation
It was an easy form to fill out. Some of the questions were difficult to understand at the end but all in all it was satisfactory.
"I was little apprehensive about the legitimacy of this young company with all the bad things I read on line and so I emailed them and they responded immediately explaining the process.  With that I went ahead and made a purchase of an ESA letter for air travel.  The next day I received a response with an attached letter by a doctor in Hawaii.  Again, I was a little apprehensive so I called the doctor and he answered on the first try.  He was a retired radiologist, a nice person, now working for emotional support.  We had a nice conversation and he assured me that they never had a letter rejected by the airlines.  I considered this call my first therapy session.  My original letter and dog ID badge came a few days letter by mail.  I plan to travel next month and test the letter with the airlines.  More updates to come.
Regarding the purchasing experience, there were a few glitches in the website, namely my billing address street number and name wasn't showing correctly in the summary page so I added the same address again for shipping to ensure that the information was correct.  Also, each time I went back to change information the State box kept defaulting to armed services.  Other than that, the order was processed efficiently."
Not to extensive and appreciate the fact that a doctor will review my information. Have not taken my flight yet. But did happen to notice that it is a licensed social worker not a physician.
I liked the ease of use but the electronic signature was tricky. I may have more to say once I get some responses and the document itself but so far it has been nice. Like that it is BBB recognized.
The form was not difficult to fill out. I hope it works so I can visit my daughter 2000 miles away.
Very easy to understand. Not too much going on with page to confuse someone.
I didn’t get to finish entering mailing address and the co formation message cut Me off.
Great experience with the application. Looking forward to see my results
It was really easy and made the whole complicated experience of getting a letter much better for me!
Everything was easy to understand. I hope it helps me keep my furry loved ones. I don't know what I'd do without them.
I have not been approved or informed of denial as of now but the process was very easy and I recommend it to people who actually have issues with their mental/emotional health.
"I am still awaiting the arrival of my ESA Letters, and I will do a follow-up review when I receive them.
UPDATE: I received the ESA Letters, and my Delta Form in the mail, and I was pleasantly surprised to receive them on Doctor's Letterhead, on custom paper. Professional and appropriate. When I have a need to renew my ESA Letters, I will be returning as a repeat customer."
Very easy and user friendly. Well done but a little unsure if any further documentation is required at any step.
Easy to use but also thorough with the information. I also like how the airline form options are already included to make the process easier down the line as well.
Just buy it when I receive it and everything is correct I will write a feedback. Thanks
ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SITE. and the staff. Always so polite & efficient. I would suggest them to anyone who needs an emotional support pet. I would simply die without my Buddy.
I read reviews and even checked out the BBB to ensure validity. I think it would be nice to offer a military/veteran discount as well. Granted I found a 10% coupon. Everything was upfront and very well put together. Thank you.
I’m hoping this is legit and I will wait and see to leave a better review.
It's been fine. I got confused a few times and had to redo the questionnaire because I missed the tick mark for only housing. It would be nice if we could go back from the payment screen and edit.
Very responsive so far. Just hoping to get an email copy of these forms since I plan to fly out tomorrow and I won't receive the mailed forms in time before my flight. Thanks!!
I was actually recommend to this site by a coworker. Although it was kind of expensive I liked my experience.
I don't like how vague the renewal process seems.  Make it a little more personalized.
Having never done something like this before I found it easy to follow and timely.
"The price was descent, $89 and change with a coupon for just the housing letter. The service took less than a couple hours from payment to approval and receiving the digital form and I didn't pay for any rush processing or anything. I'm only slightly concerned about the validity of the ESA letter for housing purposes as it was signed off by a radiologist licenced in Hawaii when I'm living in Utah. It's slightly disconcerting..."
The process was easy and extremely quick.  I was approved and emailed copies of my letter within hours of completion.  However the website wasn't clear about the Travel ID Cards.  I couldn't find any information about that.  Thankfully
The service was very easy and fast. It got to the point and I appreciate that a lot these days
Easy shopping experience - no one called me to confirm but i got the letter immediately. There is a news article about how this particular doctor is a scam though. Not sure how that will be useful once the landlord googles the name.
Quick and easy for the most part. Hopefully the results are as good as the shopping experience.
I had a good shopping exp. But I feel that it was kinda sketchy because I couldn't find good information about how reliable and certified this site is so I was skeptical
Great website easy to use and all questions where mostly answered on the site.
I hope this senses me to get my pet at last. Sure would help with the loneliness
So far its been okay will update when I get everything and try to use the letter.
I get that this is technically a loophole and im fine with that nor am i paying some exorbitant amount of money so he can live with me.
It was a good experience. Stressful to write my personal history. But professional.
Online was easy but i wont know if i got what i needed until i see the letters
I have never done anything like this online so it was a little unusual but the site made it very easy to understand and get through the process.  I received a very quick response which was greatly needed in my circumstance. Thank you.
Quick turn around. Thank you so much for getting me my papers on time and efficiently.
I had trouble with the form evertime I saved it
It’s fine. To the point and straight forward. The prices just need to be stated upfront such as what a fast review will cost.
I can't really give 5 stars until I receive all the info in the mail. So far its been straightforward with fantastic pricing and clear instructions.
This was easy to navigate and very straight forward. I ordered the ID card and the picture is not good. It was probably partly the picture I submitted but she's blue and orange. It will do the trick though
Finished the form and now I am waiting to hear back from them! hopefully they get back to me soon so that I know if I can bring my dog with me.
Fast and easy. The letter lists the website at the bottom which I hope is not going to be a problem with the airline b
Things worked will update if the product is not delivered as described.
things have been easy thus far. but i am anxious to see the end results.
So far i've enjoyed this website. I was referred by a co-worker so I hope this website is legit.
My experience so far has been very smooth.  Let's see how it goes from here on in.
It was easy and quick....just hope it works for my dog so we can travel with him.
It was simple and to the point however slightly confusing when it came to delivery options/add-on expenses
quick and easy would suggest ability to print receipt when paying.  I also need a link email pic of dog for id.
Just waiting to see if the letter is quality and from a licensed MD or Therapist
I hope this is valid and won't cause me any problems when I show it as proof of need for an ESA at my apartment complex.
Thank you for the call back.  I don't understand why the saved file wasn't able to be retrieved and I had to put in everything again.
So far everything has been smooth and easy
The survey was a little too long for me but overall i feel very satisfied.
Overall very good experience but cannot confirm until I know what the outcome is
I hope this is a secure and safe site and is legit. Overall it was fast and easy
It was fine the test just doesn't accommodate someone that is not capable to fill this out.
The payment page does not itemize what makes up the total cost which is confusing because I have two pets. I need to make sure each of them has his own ID card and letter.
I am hoping that this is a valid site for TSA/flying I cannot make a full assessment until I take the letter to the airport along with the DD214 and disabled discharge paperwork
Good so far.  Was treated well and everything went through very quickly.
customer service response very quick which is good but so far I just paid the money so will see
Good customer service. Very responsive to questions/concerns of customers.
It was pleasant I'm excited for my pet to be a certified emotional  support animal.
I dont know until I receive my letterHopefully it will be stisfactory and I will tell others to  go here for help.thank you Sheila
The form was easy to fill out the only problem I had is that you could only claim 3 pets (I have 4)
I appreciate that there's a rush option and airline specific forms.  Thanks!
was a fast and easy experience. hopefully all goes smoothly for my college letter
I am thoroughly peased with the eas and thoroughness of my experience. Now I hope to see the letter works without a hitch.
Kept getting  locked on the submit form. Website would not  recognize that everything had been filled out
The website was easy to navigate unsure about my complete review until I actually get my letter
This was a good experience. I just need to know how do I get the pictures to you. Thanks!
We have submitted 6 times but never got this far
With only a few glitches..it was a decent site. I will write a more informative review after i recieve my letter and am able to keep my baby in my new apartment.
Quick effeciant. Hopefully gwt approved so my pet doesn't have to leave.
I wish there were a section to fill out what you have already been diagnosed with. Also it's tricky to pick a weight range for a cat since the options are 0-10 and 11-20
It was easy to register and apply for the animal housing letter.  I hope all the rest goes as smoothly.  Thank you.
I did not see where to upload a photo of my dog for the id card that I paid for.
Very helpful and very quick I hope I can get my letter as soon as possible
Had to retype everything a couple of times...doesn't save info if you advance....
Simple and easy to understand. Extremely prompt reply.  Could not be more pleased with your service. Thank you.
It was easy but I would like to see the final outcome and if everything falls through with my dog and flight
I had some questions that did not get answered via chat.. I wanted to know if I will need an airline specific letter i.e. American later in the year can I have that added on to my order? Also is there a discount for coming back next year?
The experience was good.  I can give a better rating once I receive the letter
I just had to refill my info since the back button did not work in check out stage.
Everything was great except the signature because if you try to erase the signature to do it again the system deletes everything.
It was super easy I loved that it explains everything where you can understand it
It was easy. Its good to write down your experiences and feelings knowing a professional looks at it. It is a weird but good for of therapy in itself.
I can't really comment on anything because I have not gotten a letter back.  I can say more once I receive it and it is approved by the housing.
the buying process is simple but would like to see a sample letter ahead so that I can know it meets the requirements for the airline
Had to submit a few times so this was first rating but otherwise I liked my experience
I hope I can bring an emotional support dog into my home with a esa letter.
Was extremely happy with how fast everything was done. Had our letters within 24 hrs. Which was perfect because we already had a new ESA dog. Thanks so much.
So far so good but will reserve comments after letter is received and accepted for living in an apartment.
How can i say how good your service is when i havent gotten my documents yet ?
Seems quick and easy and I checked to make sure they are licensed and they are
Easy to use and extremely satisfied with the amount of time it took to get my letter
Seems quick and easy.  A little more info about what to expect or sample of letter to be received would be helpful
It was good I just had a problem because my gmail account was not correct that i sent so i am using my wives
Too soon to tell if this is legit seemed too simple. Hope I'm not getting ripped off.
I just could not find the phone number until i completed the application. I had a question to ask...Hopefully you will be contacting me via email and we will make any necessary corrections. Thanks
I was unable to complete this on my phone and had to use my IPad with wifi connection
Seems good so far.  I got kicked out of the sight once right at the end so had to start over and had a hard time with the system accepting my email address
Haven't received anything yet  website was easy to use and easy to understand. Great options
so far so good. I just hope that its a legitimate letter with all the necessary elements needed for both airline and landlord
It says if you would like to save and continue later click and link will be sent to you email. NEVER RECEIVED LINK. Also contacted support before adding payment info because it mentions credit card like I'd tag with a picture of MY dog. That option IS NEVER MENTIONED WHEN ORDERING. Corrected problem through customer service.
I cannot fully rate and review this as of yet because I have only just purchased my letter and submitted the exam.  So based on everything thus far
We just got our new address for Georgia. Could someone get ahold of me so I can get my information updated. Thank you
It was very quick and easy!  just kept having trouble with the internet here so took a little longer to fill out!!
Whenever I got stuck with sending it the answer was just a phone call away. Very helpful.
The representative that called me was extremely helpful and informative.
So far so good the experience has been quick easy and smooth would recommend
Very easy but lost info on form when I went back to review my email was correct. Second try was a charm!
Everything was pretty straight forward but I'm not sure if the form saved.
Everything seems to be going well so far I haven't received the letter yet
So far this has been a very responsive program.  I like that a experienced psychologist reviews information before a decision is made regarding an emotional support animal prescription
"I had requested a letter for Hawaiian airlines, but have not received! Otherwise"
Had a small glitch with technology called and was walked through the process. Thank you for the great customer service!
It all went off well except for uploading the picture. I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working but your customer service rep Sarah
I had problems trying to use different billing and shipping addresses.  When going to the previous page changes I had made would revert and I would have to redo the changes.  I spent considerable time trying to get the transaction to go through with no messages displayed to indicate what the problem was.  Now but I had to use my card as that was the only way it would go through.  :(
It has been pretty simple so far.  I will have a better idea when the service is completed.
Im not sure how this is going to go. Id like to answer these questions when I get to my destination
couldnt renew mine from you guys same time last year
New format ...wish there were a few more instructions.  Checked no mail necessary and still charged me $10.  Also was not sure which airline to choose. Hope I can get that later.
Everything was very simple but thorough. I feel confident in this site.
I didnt understand how the process is. Is the letter will have the stamp? I will like to now if i will received an ID of my dog.
I was disappointed that I need a special form for each airline. Not your fault but the older I get the harder it is.  Fixed incomes not fun to deal with. Again not your problem.
I haven't actually received anything. So I'm still unsure about the service.
Why doesn't my address show?  I've tried three separate times - if you cannot track my address how can you mail me a letter?
The site was easy to use but wouldn’t accept the credit card I wanted to use.
I am not sure yet. I completed everything last night and still have received no email call
I was not told the physician would be out of state. The apartment I wanted to rent questioned the letter due to the physician being so far away. I wish this would have been more transparent in the description prior to purchase. Otherwise everything else was wonderful.
Details section is really hard to type into and u can’t copy and save. Too easy to lose info already typed
Not sure what to say as of yet. I used a different sight last time and had guaranteed lawyer help which was a HELPFUL thing. If I have any issues i will certainly contact you!
Living with a TBI is not easy. I've heard that we do not pick a cat; they pick us. My cat and I are best(est) buds. It is very reassuring that I have protected our bond with the ESA ID and documentation.
The price is the best I have found plus it was the only place that would add a second animal without having to have a completely separate letter.
Its a little confusing and hard to understand when you ask the same question 100 times
I felt the extra charges that keep popping up make me irritated.  I'm not sure why I pay 10 extra $ for a letter.
Good service but the website is hard to follow and needs updating. It is sometimes confusing and frustrating to not know something cost anything and being surprised when I see it at checkout. Overall a fairy good experience.
I mean I just purchased this hasn't even been a minute so I really can't say how the shopping experience has been... Quick? I guess? I'll let you know if and when I get my letter.
initially says you can instantly print out letter for free during checkout says you have to pay an additional $35 in order to do that
I am giving 3/5 stars because i am reviewing before i receive any feedback from the company
Kind of confusing. It says free exam but I have to pay? I probably wouldn't have paid
Ihave not received the certificate yet will let you know after my problem has been resolved.  Thank you.. Bianca
Wish I knew that I would get 10% off if I took the qualifying examination before I paid full price. Not very happy about that and kind of feel taken advantage of.
Site is very user friendly the satisfaction guarantee is greatly appreciated. Excited to see the result.
i had to keep answering the same questions and then when doing spell check i had to start over
I'm a little nervous.   No one answered the phone for verification regarding this business.
Very quick and easy.  Was recommended by a friend. Had issues with apartment complex as letter received was exact same as friend.  They questioned the legitimacy of the letter.  Gave me their forms to have signed and submitted.  Sent back within a day and no issues bringing back to complex.
I could not upload the picture from my phone. I had to complete on a computer.
It was self explanatory. I'm excited to see if my new landlord excepts it.
This my second attempt to buy this service. I hope I have better luck this time.
I'm interested to see if this will help me. My situation is sort of dire.
I just submitted my application. I have not seen any results. I have to wait to see if it helps my situation.
This was not an accessible letter for the HOA since it was not coming from a real Doctor.  I also did not receive my 20% off from the promotion ESA2018. Please send the money ASAP
I tried to do this before but it did not go through and I had to do everything all over again.
I do not like how the extra prices are not shown. My total is now  $219 but I thought I only had $50 worth of add ons. Because of that I may not recommend depending on if my price is right. I may not buy again if I can not see the individual totals.
Your form would not fill correctly.  My phone # is 602-614-3730. I would input and it showed another prefix and changed the state validation below.  I am in ARIZONA.  10 TIMES. I DON'T KNOW IF IT  TOOK CORRECTLY THIS LAST TIME.
They give you a letter from a therapist that is not licensed in your state. This makes it so your housing company can deny you.
It is not telling me anything I better not get a second charge. Only reason need is her doctor is out of town.
"I paid for the ""reasonable accommodation"" form $20  my initial payment and I just got charged again!"
Irvine Company does not accept letters from this company. Money down the drain.
The form they sent looks like something I could have made myself and it says it's issued by the State of California when I live in Utah. I tried contacting them for a refund and you can't even talk to a person or leave an actual message.
I paid extra money to get my stuff the next day it hasn't shown and it's been four days now I'm not happy at all you guys ripped me off when I could of just went standard and got it at the same time and not have to pay 30 dollars for both things not cool and won't go throw you guys again
Very easy process and I am confident it is official. They actually call you with a therapist in your area and make sure all your needs are met.
So far so good. Can't wait to see how the rest of my experience is. It was great very easy yet informative.
Your company helps those that do not know how to get over the hurdles of travelling and living peacefully with their pets...I am grateful.
So far everything has went smoothly. Hoping my apartment accepts. Everything has been super fast and simple!
I love the face that I don't have to worry anymore about leaving my only security
Very easy process and also affordable way to make my pet an official emotional support animal.
awesome company. great customer service who guided me through everything. I spoke to Julia. I got my esa documents to fly the same day. They even do a customized letter from delta documents which they filled out for me. I recommend for anyone needing to live with an esa dog or fly with one.
thank you so much for helping me with my situation. My Dog has been helping get through things in life. THANK YOU!
it has been such a relieve to be able to find people like you willing to help people like me
Counselor called exactly as scheduled on time. Conversation was relatively painless. It brought up some emotions
GetEsa is so quick and easy. They understand how we feel and how much we need our dog around us to feel comfortable. Thank you so much Get Esa!
So far it was easy. I will be happy as long as I get a letter signed by a licensed therapist in my state.
Easy and clear info They guided me step by step through the process
Getesa answered all my questions about certifying my little buddy so I can have her with me when I travel by plane. They also have very good reviews
All good except I would have liked a hyperlink that goes directly to the ESA letter renewal.  Thank you!
I'm not one to ask. Myself and my Dads dog Harley. Are upset. I lived with my Dad and Harley for over a year. And I have to say that Harley always was a bright spot in both of our lives. My father died in December and I have back problems.  But he will get me off my butt.
I was a little confused about the timer. I was waiting to be redirected to a clinician but realized I had to buy first
The entire process was Very Simple I was able to get all my things in order so my Pet could accommodate me on my upcoming travel plans . They even helped with further questions
