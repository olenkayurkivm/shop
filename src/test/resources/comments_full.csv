Such a great experience! Very quick & painless! The ID card & printed letter was mailed very quick & the email of course was within 24 hours & the response was almost instant! I already got everything approved with my housing department & it is all perfect. HIGHLY RECOMMEND :)
Customer service is the best I have ever dealt with!!  Replied to both email and phone message immediately and went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied.
I am very happy. I would highly recommend. Very helpful and very nice.
Service was extremely fast i paid for the 6-12 hour option and was approved in only 3 hours!
Everything about this product is great!!!! Feel good to know I can have my best friend by my side at all time!!!!!
Fast customer service. Will give this letter to my landlord and see if he accepts it. Thank you
Get Esa did an outstanding job with helping me obtain an ESA letter. Customer service was quick and helpful when it came to answering my questions and concerns. The doctor assigned to my case was helpful and respected my privacy asking me what information was okay to disclose on the accommodation form my apartment required. Overall it was a great experience and recommend to anyone who is in need of an ESA letter.
Quick response great customer service and quality. I would recommend to everyone
Fast friendly and very helpful. I will be able to keep my baby Rei in my apartment with this doctors note. Thank you. I highly recommend! And the best price around as well!
Needed for a house rental  Awesome I should have done this two months ago  What a relief!
"I received an email back from customer service very quickly & wonder of wonders, the same person called me back within 3 minutes when I called his number to assure me that my letter would arrive that same evening.  It did & was very professionally written to include the ADA federal laws specific to my case. thank you."
I needed this asap as I just learned my uncle was taken to the ER in Tennessee and I live in California.
Literally a life savor. My apartment complex has been harassing me about my baby and I'm 9 months pregnant. They gave me 24 hours to remove her or a week to get out. Disgusting. I'll be so happy to hand deliver this letter to management. THANK YOU SO MUCH!
With help from getesa.com I am now able to get the service dog I so desperately need. My letter was professional and well written! Thank you! Thank you! From the bottom of my heart!!
The quality of service and support was excellent and they provided a very timely response. I would highly recommend their service to everyone.
Prompt thorough
So easy and such a load off my shoulders- I thought I'd have to give up my baby pup. Thank you so much!!!
I have a 40 year old daughter with Down Syndrome. She has had her little Maltese/dachshund mix for 7 years. Milsy is well behaved and Jessica loves her. Stephanie has a letter from her Dr stating that she would benefit from having her dog with her. She is moving into an apartment and will be overseen by a company contracted with the State of Washington to help people with disabilities to live the most independent life possible. Can you believe these are the ONLY people to not accept the letter from her physician?!?!. The letter from GetESA is very complete and specific. The price is very worth the product. This is the second time I have purchased an accommodation letter and if I had more animals or need this service in the future Jessica will acclimate to her new surroundings so much better with her BEST FRIEND at her side! Thank you for helping my daughter to truly live the most active and happy life possible. And little Milsy thanks you too!!
"First and foremost, this was the easiest and most secure way to obtain an ESA letter for air travel. I purchased the package for $149 and I could NOT be more satisfied. I paid for the 6-12 hour rush and it was completed within 4 1/2 hours. You cannot beat this type of customer service. Correspondence were clear and concise allowing me to focus on the important items before my flight. Thank you so much for the service provided and documents received. I will recommend you to every one I know. To add, this letter is also acceptable with my civilian human resources office in regards to disability identified during hiring."
Fast and simple. Letter received exactly as expected and even received a confirmation text message of email receipt. Highly recommend.
There was a mistake in my papers for housing and airline. But they helped me and fixed the problem within the same day!
I am so grateful for this service and appreciate how quick the reply was.  I will be able to take my support dog with me to visit family now otherwise I would not have been able to go without her.
"ESA, I am so grateful, extremely thankful for your existence. You have helped me be able to to travel with my dog and your service is easy and fast as your other valued customers have commented. I thank you so much and I would absolutely recommend you to my friends who would need the same help! Thank you!!! You made my Day filled too because I got to bring my baby puppy with me! "
I found myself in a touch place having just relocated to a new state turning 26 and losing my health insurance
"Beyond pleased with GetEsa and their services!! I did my due dilligence in researching different sites to find the best place (for me that meant finding a site that was valid, accredited, and would provide what I needed expeditiously at a good price) to assist in establishing my chihuahua as my emotional support animal and provide a letter for an upcoming flight. Get ESA was very quick to answer many questions I had prior to going through the process which put my mind at ease that I had found the best company to execute this service. They were very quick to provide me with my letter within an hour or me submitting my information (they do have an option to rush your application if necessary which is great because I was waiting on verification before booking a flight - though even if you don't opt for the priority rush, their guidelines for turn around seemed *very* reasonable). Furthermore, I submitted my request AND received my letter on a Saturday night from a certified medical professional! I couldn't be more pleased with my experience with Get Esa!"
Very quick, received a response by 6:00am after submitting at 12:30am. Very pleased with the quality and care provided by getesa.com team. I would definitely recommend this website.
Very helpful and fast. Appreciate what they do and highly recommen to anyone.
The entire process was easy and made me feel comfortable and confident. I was really surprised with how quickly I received my order and was contacted by a doctor.
Love the service and the phone call by the doctor. Thank you all good and very satisfied
They were very responsive and professional. Nice to have them do exactly as they said.
The way it takes you through everything is very simple and user firendly. I liked it. Thanks
My shopping experience was really good. There weren’t any issues with the transaction or ordering
The process was explained clearly and straightforwardly-not as complicated as I expected!
Worked out great. Isn't completely helpful because you need a dr's not to support it. Better options online for sure.
I’m very satisfied with how detailed the questionnaire was - knowing it was coming from a company with genuine concern for mental health along with legitimacy.
Ordering was straightforward and easy to understand. The response is also prompt which is what i need.
Thank u!! Thank u !! For your help  You make me happy!! Excellent service and very fast.
It was very straightforward and informative. The questions weren't hard to answer either. It was sent to me quickly and they went above and beyond to help me.
Great service and very easy to ask questions and get the help you need!
Excellent customer service and prompt.  I will definitely use them again!
Many sites exist for these services.  I felt that this site was the most trustworthy.
I like the system so far! It was very understandable and clear to me. Hoping for fast receiving of my permits
The experience was very simple and informative.  I would recommend this to others.
service seems comprehensive easy to use. I await the end product to see if it is what i need
So far so good very easy to understand and able to get assistance when needed.
THEY WERE VERY WELL EDUCATED ON THE BREED OF DOG I HAVE. AND ASKED ALL OF THE NEEDED QUESTIONS TO ENSURE EVERYONE'S SAFETY IN OUR SITUATION. I ENJOYED THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE AND WILL BE USING THE SITE IN THE FUTURE. I'VE ALREADY RECOMMENDED IT TO A FEW FRIENDS.
Really good experience shopping on this site. It had all the information I needed and really helped a lot in making my decision.
This is a very user friendly easy to fill out form and a quick response. Thank You!
The ordering process went smoothly and now I need to make sure I get the paid for items and they are legit.
Process was quick and easy.  True test will be airline's acceptance of credentials.
It was easy to use I'm unsure if my landlord will accept yet but I hope he does because I really need my dog.
It was a great website it was really easy to be able to get what i needed for my dog.
This is such an important service for families like ours. Thank you so much for your help.
i found it to be very easy simple and painless (and stress free!) to order my letter.
Was very quick they seemed to ask questions about what I was having issues with. Very easy.
I feel confident that I am taking the right steps toward me and my pets future.
Really good price and easy to navigate through! Got my approval super fast!
quick and painless - hopefully the review process is just as quick within the 48 hour window!
So far it has been very fast and well understood! Satisfied so far!
"Of course, review is predicated upon actually receiving the letter I am purchasing.  Website was easy to use and understand."
This makes it so easy for someone with a disability who maybe can’t afford to pay the high rates of a doctor for a letter that is a necessity for those depending on ESAs thank you
its the best options that you give to the customer thanks for everything
Getesa has made health services quick reliable and affordable!
I was in need of the registration fast and had it within 3 hours which I did not expect.
Such an easy process! I am so grateful there are options such as these for people like myself. Bless yall!!!!!
"When I was trying this site out, there were few real reviews that were helpful. Hopefully this one alleviates some folks' concerns. I worked on several sites last night from 1:30am or so until about 3am and finally decided on this one. They ask in depth questions and allow you to write in your input about the reasons you feel you need an ESA. For me, this was excellent as I wanted to make sure the person reviewing this had the truth from me. At around 2:30am or so I realised I forgot to add a crucial part of my address in and replied to the email sent to me, expecting a Do Not Reply automatic response. Barely 5 minutes later, someone answered that it'd been changed for me. Skip to today. I paid extra to have my order reviewed faster and by the time it was 10:30am I had gone to a shelter to look at a dog to adopt and needed to have some questions concretely answered. Emailed them again asking for a call, and about 10 minutes later someone called me to let me know my PDF papers were emailed to me and the gentleman answered my questions patiently and sat for a good 20 minutes explaining the anxious details to me, even giving me verbiage to give to my apartment. I promptly forgot this and opted to email them my PDF file as I don't have the actual paperwork yet. He gave me information on the person who reviewed and approved my case and I was pleased to find that the lady was actually licensed in my state. They encourage you to call back with any questions or concerns and let you know to call back if you need to change anything, such as adding airplane forms to your order later down the road. I also managed to find a coupon online for this which knocked the price down some for me which was excellent. I've already recommended this site to another friend who was questioning me about what site I did use because of the excellent customer service I've received so far and how much they alleviated my anxieties about this entire process of possible confrontation with my landlords and whatnot. So far, so good. I hope this helps."
Easy to navigate instructions clear. Process very transparent and I was able to have my ESA status approved and confirmed prior to an upcoming travel obligation.
VERY easy! This site was recommended by a friend. I'm glad I followed his advice!
Easy and accurate with their offer to register and evaluate your need for emotional support companion
Timely I got everything I paid for. Excellent customer service. I wholeheartedly recommend getesa.com.
Fast and easy. Haven't received the letter yet so my experience with them is not complete but so far so good.
Super easy to complete. My concerns were addressed in a timely manner prior to signing up.
Your website answered all of my questions. so far the process has been easy to do!
Easy to follow and is a reasonable price especially for people with financial difficulties
Fast and easy! Glad this is here to help out specially veterans who need it! Thank you!
So far everything seems great but the chat feature did not work and I'm concerned that I had to pay before receiving confirmation that I would get the certificate.
Easy form to use and submit. The turn around time after paying for the expedited letter was incredible.
This process seems to be as quick and painless as you guys say it is. By far my day has been made.
Great website and service can't wait to receive my ESA letter for my dog. You guys are awesome thank you.
So far the site moved smoothly and was easy to navigate and move through. Interested to see if you can help me with my request.
This was a great experience and I hope to receive my ESA paperwork shortly.
Great.. My dog was approve by the airline the next buis day... I'm very satisfied
Its a real thing to feel like someone could try to tell u they dont accept your way of coping with life. Some people let stress effect them in a variety of situations ways.  Thank you for helping me confidently say i have rights too .
It was simple and quick. The pages were a bit overloaded with content (images and text)
Exam was very detailed and helped me describe my feelings and what I️ am suffering with.
Thank you!  My Little Prince keeps me calm and keep me from being lonely.
Very thorough but easy to navigate. I checked several reviews and thought GetEsa was most professional.
So far the experience has been great.  I just completed the application but had a question and called CA and they called back within 5 minutes! After answering a couple questions I felt even better about my choice to go with Getesa.  Then I received my letter in 24 hours.  I would recommend this company to anyone needing their services.
Most straight to the point website ever super easy. Just received my letter and ID Cards in the mail and it's a super legit website. Thanks guys will be renewing with you guy.
So long as this works out and I didn't pay  for nothing then I am sold. It was a very clear and simple form.
It was easy to navigate through and asked questions i could really relate to!
Excellent overall.  I would strongly recommend that each extra you choose expedited or housing accommodation  letter etc. should be displayed on the payment page when you are checking out.  It makes it easier to know what service to remove if the cost is too high.  I found my self going back to the application several times to remove a service when I saw the cost go over $150.00.  Making this adjustment will make the site more transparent and make the whole transaction feel more honest and above board.
Thank you for your assistance. I use my little dog in therapy sessions in another state so you've been so helpful to get him approved quickly!
Thank You for Helping me with my battle to have a pet to help my anxiety!
Very easy process! I was anxious about completing this
I highly recommend getesa! Finally I could find a new place to rent. It was super fast and easy! Thank you for your service!!!
this was easier that I thought for such a much needed service. thank you so much!
Excellent service for cheap price in comparison to most of the competency.
I haven't finished my process yet but as long as the letter works as it should this process was very simple and quick!
I was completely satisfied with the entire process. I look forward to telling you that the ultimate results were successful.
Very easy to understand and a load off my shoulders knowing I could get the help I need
So far it was easy and quick hopefully I get my letter as soon as possible.
I have not yet confirmed approval so cannot comment if it was successful.
Super easy process ! Got my approval letter the same exact day. Just excited I get to keep my best friend highly recommend !
"I received exactly what was promised, promptly and professionally.  Couldn't be happier. Thank you!"
Mrs. Mateo is personally helpful quick to reply
Thank you for helping out. your are a life saver in helping me keep my emotional support animal
Got my letter the following day. Great service. Landlord wanted my little one in a kennel and I can now sleep at night with him by my side.
Quick easy.  I still haven't received any confirmation that I will be approved for a letter
A system that works for those of us who don’t leave the house and need the support of our pet
I am happy you are BBB accredited. It gives me reassurance you arent a scam site like many others. I also like there is a money back guarantee.
I will not be able to give a full review until my order & experience has been completed
The entire experience has been awesome! It's super quick! I had my housing letter within 24 hours and when I had additional forms that needed signed I was able to email them and have them back signed within 6 hours! I've already recommended these services to my mother in law
it was easy to complete the application. This will make traveling so much less stressful.  Especially as we get older.
I had a lot of questions and called the Newport Beach office. Was immediately called back by Robert and all of my questions were answered kindly and at ease. My experience with Robert alone is enough to make me recommend this site to others. Thank you!
Application process was easy. Looking forward to receiving the product.
easy and thorough....  just received today....very positive professional experience! Many thanks from me and PUTTER!
Everything was simple quick and easy. Just hoping I get approved since this is online. Currently waiting for the Psychologist to sign my forms that were mailed to her :)
So far it's been really easy
Easy to shop and navigate throw the website. Its simple and easy to go to tabs.
Wish it was this easy to get an appt. with a psychologist. Has relieved the stress of not being able to travel. Thank you.
Hopefully I will fly without any difficulties. Thank you so much for your professional and expedited service!
Everything seems great excellent customer service I will lose $$$$ in airline tickets, car rentals, etc - if they don't :(
it seems so far to be pretty awesome. Only paid $99 for a certification....hopefully i can get it soon.
Was worried about not getting letter for upcoming flight in two weeks.Thank you so much for the promptness in sending the letter. The process was much easier than I anticipated.
Had my concerns at first but it turned out to be a stress reliever bc of the easy process.
This has to be the easiest and cheapest way to get a letter for a support animal takes the stress out of it!
Easy Fast and to the point. Doesn't ask a lot of questions about things not related to task at hand.
Ordering online was a snap; waiting to see if end result is as promised.
Very easy website to use I had questions and they were answered very quickly
I had shopping around for this service and decided to subscribe to GET ESA. Your organisation is truly an Animal Advocates  just like myself
Everything was simple quick and easy. Just hoping I get approved since this is online
Very informative and easy for those of us that have companions this is needed.
This site is great reasonably priced and I haven't even been approved yet.
The entire process was fast and simple I can only cross my fingers at this point and hope that this works for me and my pup!
This has been so easy that I did not have to leave home to have my pets serviced.
I have to see first how soon I get my letter and everything before I can give five stars but it seems great so far!
It was simple answering the questions and doing it online provided a stress free environment.
I was able to reach Robert on the phone and get help with all my questions. The customer service is exceptional!
It's hard to figure out what is real or not. I'm glad to find something reliable.
Very easy just paid for it and just sent in picture of my dog. We will see when it all arrives. I received it and it was so easy the process. I loved how customer service responded with all questions I had immediately. And it made it worry free.
It is a very thorough evaluation  I truly appreciate the help of the doctors and the site .
The site is rally easy to maneuver/ comprehend. I like that it explains everything it asks
I don't have to give up my little buddy because of these majestic people
Really hoping you guys turn out to be as efficient and awesome as promised! If everything works out I will definitely recommend this service!
The survey really got me thinking. I may look into more therapy options too.
it was fine I got a letter from a previous therapist but she has moved.
Great site for people who need the help and support but don't want to spend hundreds on therapy.
i am speechless until i see whats the out come  but in general i feel better that my daughter she is going to have some right
Very easy to fill out questionnaire and I received a call shortly after requesting one
Getesa offers amazing and quick service. Their customer service is top-notch and I'm so lucky that I found them! They streamlined the process and went above and beyond to help with my needs! 5-Stars! Highly recommended! thank you thank you thank you! XOX
Very quick had the PDF letter in a couple hours. Very affordable for two dogs.
Was quick and easy to submit. I appreciated that they had letter for specific airlines that needed it.
So far it has been easy but we will see once I get the letter needed. My review may change.
Easy to navigate and understand.  I had my PDF letter within a couple of hours and the hard copy arrived in less than a week.   The price was very reasonable.
thank you so much. This helped me so much because without this letter I can't concentrate on my work at all and my pet will be cry at home everyday too
Very quick and easy.  It's expensive and hard to keep going for a Doctors letter.  Hopefully this will work.. Thank you
So far the experience is good I'm interested to see how well this works with the forms
If I've used your service in the past do I need to refill her all the information again?
Took longer than expected but website pretty user friendly  Received item quickly and efficiently
Quick and easy! Excited that rushes options are available. The document I received is very professional and was sent to me in a very quick manner (extra cost). Would highly recommend this site to anyone looking for official documentation.
the process so far has been pretty painless. I needed one thing in life to be stress free and this was!
Cheaper than the other sites and they were upfront with the cost which felt more honest rather than therapy pet.org where they surprised me with a cost that was $60 more.
So far so good I just ordered this and haven't received yet to give a review.
I'm so happy I didnt have to go into details I was uncomfortable with in my situation. So useful!
It was very easy to use and I'm sure the outcome of using your website will be beneficial for me.
The site is easy to use and there are varying options to for all your ESA needs. It is much appreciated.
Best ever! Would and will recommend this service to any and all that are in this situation... Thank you!
Thank you for being here to help me get my dog to be my emotional support dog
My representative answered my questions in a professional timely manner and was very helpful.
So far this has been very easy.  I hope it helps me.  Looking for a place to live is stressful.
I chose the 48-72 hour time frame to receive my PDF and results. I received both within 2 hours after submitting my exam. Customer service was great in assisting me when I had questions.
You made it easy use and understand. You helped ease my anxiety. Thank you.
it is a simple but complex process for something that can make all the difference.
"My experience with Get esa was great from the beginning. Doctor and her assistants are very informative and I have not received better communication from other doctors that provide similar services. So I would highly recommend them and for sure use their services in a future!!! 
What I also highly appreciate is their ongoing support. Recently my apartment complex lost the docs for my dog and they tried to hit me with huge financial penalties... thank to the fast reaction and help I have received from Get Esa the matters where taking care of for me and it saved me so much stress. Thank you!!!"
Good information but stressful for me.  I thought I could use the coupon pet2019 but could not locate space
Very easy.... great information.  Thanks for completing the airline forms as well.
Smooth fair prices as long as it works.  100% satisfaction guarantee is what made me pull the trigger!
so far so good as long as everything goes smoothly getting my letter :)
Great service and quick response.  Only one problem I had was that my hard copy letter had a tear in it from the cards.  Otherwise perfect!
Thank you for making this quick and efficient. The convenience of this site is exceptional and I appreciate all of the help you have provided so far. Thank you!
So far this has been very easy and the reviews are great so far! Excited to get her letter and use this for other services like flying!
Site is easy to use and is causing me to feel a lot more secure in my decision to apply.
I was very skeptical of this actually working and being from valid physicians. It worked and it was wonderful! During the process I had many questions and concerns since I was so skeptic and the support people were very timely in replying as well at patient with my many questions for them. I really appreciated how fast and helpful this experience was. They truly want to help you.
I called in because of several questions and the answers I received were in depth and direct. Couldn't have hoped for a better experience.
They were so prompt about my situation which is what i was really needing! My landlord was trying to make me get rid of my cats or move. within 2 days i received my letter by mail for my land lord and within 24 hours i had the same letter e-mailed to me. My case was received and responded to within 24 hours! Amazing and they were able to make all 3 of my cats my emotional support pets. I will say i paid the extra price in order to get Mt results so quickly
I just completed the order it was extremely easy. I hope everything is going to work smoothly.
It was easy.  I wish it was a bit less expensive though.  It seems a little over the top to pay $20.00 for a piece of paper to be mailed to me.
I talked to a representative at the California office and he was very friendly and knowledgeable
easy however doesn't explain WHEN you receive an answer. Its confusing when you see the video that says you get an answer in a day...(even on weekends????   Then it offers a RUSH charge....but doesn't explain if that is for the letter emailed response OR to pay for the ush on ID's & hard copy letters etc.  So that was my only confusion and should be written clearer.
Really quick great service! I verified all credentials beforehand just in case and I just used it for my first flight with my baby no problem! Thank you so much!
Thank you so much for the timely response. I highly appreciate it. This is perfect!
So far this has been the best offer of an online emotional pet certification letter I've seen.
"You guys ROCK! Great turnaround and incredible service. I want to personally thank Lee, who was exceptional and wonderful to work with."
this was a very thorough form and easy to fill out and also gave me great information on the individual requirements for the different airlines which is helpful. thanks you!
Robert is awesome! I submitted a question on line and he called me with the answer in less than 5 minutes. You guys ROCK!!!
Was really easy to fill out! The letter is just as good :) highly recommended!
A customer friendly website that was easy to use.  Fast and efficient results within 24 hrs. I highly recommend this company.
I did not know how to proceed with this process and found your website when I googled it.  This was a lot easier than I thought it would be.
I called first and left a message about questions I had and a gentleman called me back promptly once the office opened and answered all my questions and assured me of the validity of the service.
This did not feel as invasive as I thought it would. I appreciate that.
I just want someone to check in to ensure I received my letter and it worked for the intended purpose after I receive it.
I like how you got to explain about your life so the doctor has a feel for what you have been through in your life!
Quick and easy also customer service called me back quickly after I requested a call back to answer my questions before purchasing
I lost my insurance recently and unable to get my ESA letter renewed and GetEsa came through for me. A++++
I was anxious to go through this process but it was very simple to navigate. Thank you
It was great. I liked that I actually spoke to someone from Dr. Meltzer's office about my mental health.
Your questions were accurate but non-invasive.  Also I went back to add two airlines after I had made the purchase and you corrected the accidental dual purchase without me having to contact you.  Great service.  Will recommend this to all my baby-boomer (65-75 years old) friends who won't travel because for their pets.
I have not received my order yet. However I just placed it & the beginning steps are very easy.
Extremely fast response. When I submitted the signed form to my leasing office they gave me their own companies form to have signed. I was concerned but I sent the form to the doctor and within 24 hours had it signed and returned. Very happy.
it's been very simple my letter came fast
I haven't been approved by my housing place yet but the doctor assigned to my case has been extremely helpful with providing me with resources necessary to defend my case(i.e. pointing me toward telehealth regulations
was quick and easy to fill out. provides a great service to people in need.
Great customer service. Called me back promptly and answered all my questions prior to purchase. Transparent pricing - website very thorough in regards to add-ons and upgrades needed. No surprises.
GREAT SITE amazing turn around time. i would recommend this to everyone.
Quick and simple process from start to end. Excellent value when compared with others offering similar services.
The questionnaire was easy and alleviated rather than caused additional stress.
Super simple and I like that they asked to explain your extenuating circumstances.
This will solve an issue for me and keep my pets with me because I really need them for my mental health.
as long as I get letter emailed within 12 hours I can give  more than 5 stars
I really like this website it asks you detailed questions about what is going on in your life and if you need help. This site is awesome for getting a ESA I would highly recommend to my family and friends!
Thoroughly explanation of what your receiving and the website alone can answer all of your questions.
Easy to submit information will update when letter is used successfully.
Thank you for this opportunity. It would make our lives so much calmer to know Spinner's can be with me.
Getting an emotional support certificate will make it possible for me to travel.  Very happy.
The exam was straight forward. I'm hopping the rest off the process is the same. Will definitely let others know!
Seems smooth.  Will let you know when I get the letter Update : this came in as promised.  Very satisfied
Very easy and user friendlyI would highly recommend this service to my friends.
I would highly recommend getesa.com. I have a great experience specially with the customer support team they will take care of your needs right away. They were very professional.
"So far the ordering process was easy. Hard to review this before I have the order though. Hopefully I get the letter within the 72 hrs. stated.
Update: Got letter in 24 hrs!! Fantastic! All set to go on my flight today. Thank u so much for the prompt, wonderful service! Will def come back!",
The shopping experience was nice and easywe will see how legit these papers are when I need to use them.
I would suggest being able to get the pet ID with the housing letter as well
Easy process informative resources I'd definitely recommend their services to others.
Easy to understand questions. Fast friendly service. Letter was approved and emailed earlier than expected.
Simple & Fast Hope It Helps Cause My Pets Are My Family & Has Helped Me through the toughest times in my life without them I'll be loss
So many fishy sites out there but this site is legit. They sent my letter by a real licensed psychologist. The letter arrived fast and is very professional. I needed just the letter to make it possible for my ESA to live with me in new apartments so I was very happy I did not have to purchase anything extra like a whole kit or an ID tag for my pet. If any family members or friends need a ESA I will definitely recommend this site.
Simple to follow I don't feel like you just trying to take my money
Customer service was helpful and quick to respond and the whole procedure seems simple from start to finish
So far this is very easy and helpful for my husband who is in need of ESA
Great easy to use service I got my letter within hours on a Sunday. I researched many ESA sites and I'm glad I chose this one. The best service and best price!
Great but accidentally reloaded page several times and had to start over.
Extremely user friendly and almost every question I had along the process was answered in fine print right below the question
I felt really good while answering the questions without being under pressure is good to know that there is a service that can bring this type of support
Was a really stress-free experience and I would recommend it to anyone who needed this service.
Quick easy process with no hidden fees. Love the 24/7 service and the rush option.  Absolutely will recommend to others. Worked with no issues for apartment complex.
This service was great. I was approved quickly and I really felt cared about. My apartment is taking a while to get back to me but the note stands. When I texted to ask a question they always got back to me within the day. I told them my landlord is taking a while to get back to me and they sent me links that reassured me and sent me next steps in case my management takes any longer or denies it. This company and resource is great!
I had a follow up question. If I now wanted to order the ID tag what would be the cost on this?
Very happy with how quickly I received everything! I am so glad my Labrador is now a registered ESA.
Everything was well explained and the assessment is easy to navigate. This is so important during an already stressful time. This site came recommended to me by a friend who has used your services and I will recommend you too.
I feel that the process was thorough and I feel confident that this service is official and will be accepted by my airline.
this service is very fast and convenient and would recommend it to others.
Great service! Very simplistic and the explanations were very understandable.
An absolutely wonderful experience. Dr. Moss and the rest of the staff was thorough approachable from the deepest part of my heart.
Very satisfied with the customer serviceproducts and service! Highly recommend.  Easy process
Thank you for making this so easy. I don't know what I would do without my girl.
So far it's been excellent. I just hope I'm approved and able to take my friend Bandit with me
This was quick and easy! Love the easy layout of the website great information
It was very fast the questions were upfront and the price was reasonable.
Very quick.  Confident that good service continues throughout the process.
Quick and easy processing. Just have to wait for the landlord approval now...
I completed my form on a Saturday afternoon with a rush order. I received my letter within twelve hours
Obviously I can't review the service properly just yet but I appreciate how easy they made the application process.
I'm so happy that I am not paying an arm and a leg for this. This actually costs me less than making a doctor appointment for this because I do not have insurance.
The application process was straight forward. The letter came fast. The follow up was good. I'd use them again.
Easy to use.  Great program too!  Card stock letter is not worth it.  I could have printed that myself on stock paper using the PDF I got for free.
Very easy to fill out not many questions and not bad of a price.
"These Folks are GREAT! They are an absolute Godsend. EZ to fill out forms and absolutely insane response time. Our HOA was threatening my wife and myself over our dogs to the point where it was affecting our health. I truly feel that getesa.com has kept our HOA from literally killing us. Obviously, I can't thank them enough. If you're in the same situation, stop reading this, quit worrying,  and submit your application already! You won't be sorry."
As a direct response digital advertising expert and customer would have sold me faster and sooner. =)
So far so good. Will see if the expedited process works as offered and paid for.
Very quick and convenient.  All information needed was easily accessible and useful.
So far so good. I thought it was going to be more stressful. I got my letter and is all messed up like it went through a storm to get here but other than that everything  about the experience was perfect. I do have the PDF file so I will use that and hopefully it will be fine.
I received my letter in less than 24 hours. I was in a rush because my family physician was unable to write one for me and I was moving in less than a week. I'm so happy I found this website!!!! I'll be recommending this site to my friends.
thank you for making this so simple and easy. It is very stress free and gives me a lot of relief
Very fast service and legit letter from a doc. Very happy with overall service!
Quick and easy to use of all the websites this offers the best service and quality.
Quick and easy-- my documents look great! Would absolutely purchase again.
Great site. Nice to know I will be able to have my ESA by my side and have my rights to do so protected.
Well it was difficult to write why I felt I needed this type of support.  I'd never written it all down and it was very heavy.
It was easy and quick. A licensed doctor contacted me very quickly and I received my letter soon after. The letter is legitimate. It was a bit pricey but worth it if you're serious about having a support animal.
Easy and quick to do as well as making me feel safe about my information
I found this site - hoping that it helps with apt searches in Cali as so many are not pet friendly or charge large fees for cats monthly and deposits.
The whole process was fast and stress free. I had my results and letter via email less then 12hours.
Very clear, detailed site. I was very pleased with the empathetic confidential way my application was taken. Thank you
I have high hopes that I will receive help and have felt much better knowing there was some place to turn to.  The directions and site were easy to follow.
The website is super easy to navigate and the forms were easy to fill out.
Very quick and easy to order! Now I'll just have to wait and see if it pans out.
Not only was the experience easily accomplished but it's for a great cause. I'm satisfied with the work ESA has done
I liked how easy it was to be so personable over the web I have trouble socializing in person doing over the web made it more easy to open up.
Good when I felt overwhelmed and could not complete. Getting back to complete was easy thank you
This site was easy to navigate and very straight forward. I appreciate the effort put into making this process less stressful.
I just submitted my request. If all goes well this was a very smooth transition.
So easy and quick.  Then I had a slight issue which was my mistake
"Very easy and simple process. I can't believe how quickly they responded to my inquiries. I recieved all my documents with in 24 hrs and When I submitted my reasonable accommodation form it was filled out and returned to me in like 6 hours.  This service is amazing and all letters are very well written by Licensed mental health clinicians with their license numbers and contact info in the documents. Rest assured you have found the right solution for your best friends needs. No more dealing with ""No pet"" or "" breed restrictions"" polices for me.   Thank you Get ESA"
The service seems accredited and meets all requirements the airline has requested. Easy form to fill out and reasonable priced.
The patches are too big for the harness and the rough velcro of the patch extends over onto the dog's skin on both sides of the harness. The sizes also run large. I bought a large and wish I had bought a medium.
Just placed my order.  Hopefully everything will be ok. Customer service is very good.
Please ship it fast I am traveling soon and need it I am praying I get it. Before the 12th please pretty please !!! Thank You I will review as the best!!!
Very easy and effective. Also doctor emails you personally and promptly if you have any questions which is great!
I had a little trouble submitting the form. When I clicked next nothing happened on my iPad and on my lap top.  I was finally able to place my order from my phone. Everything else was wonderful. Excellent customer service
Simple & straightforward. Lookin forward to being able to welcome a new furry family  member soon!
Easy and reasonably priced but I was a bit confused about what letter I needed.
Fast easy -unsure the time I would receive my letter...I need it by 8/11/2017-pray that I'll get it emailed to me ASAP
Over a year ago I thought I rescued Winnie the Cat.  It turns out she really did the rescuing. Thank you for offering a way to prove that pets provide the utmost support in our lives.  My experience with getesa.com has been seamless.
The application process is simple and gives you an opportunity to explain your unique circumstance.
Application was easy to follow. Results to be determined when received/used.
"Very prompt. Will see if it is accepted when I receive hard copy. My last name on the document misspelled!!! I sent a reply back and hope it will be corrected or I can not use the letter."
Was quick and easy. I got the letter in an email the very next day! I couldn't believe it. Leasing office accepted it with no questions or concerns! If you're looking into other websites chose this one! Trust me!
I am so pleased with the professionalism and expertise that I received. The personal follow up and quick answers to my many questions. As a result my beloved Big Foot & I are traveling without any problems on a very short notice. I'm eternally grateful they have made my relocation to Europe so much easier.
As long as this isn't a scam I will be very please with these services. Very quick and easy! Thank you!
Awesome support service center great deal everything you need. Absolutely satisfied.
Just went through the purchase.  Not sure what will happen; but so far so good.
I might follow back up and obtain a Reasonable Accommodation Form if needed. Thank you so much for the quick turn around after my personal local therapist left me in the lurch.
Very smooth and easy!  The Dr preparing the forms was very empathic and helpful to my needs and questions.  I would be pleased to recommend to anyone that needs these services!
this is really weird because i feel like im looking for for help then just shopping for an ideam?
"Vest arrived with title of  ""Service Dog"" on the side but Roscoe is an emotional support dog.  I don't want to falsify his title.  Do I need Emotional support name tag on the vest?"
Filling out the form was quick and easy.  I like that you can register more than one pet at a time rather than paying to register each pet individually.
The process to get my dog his ESA cert was fast and easy! I had the documents in less than a day.
I had an easy shopping experience and look forward to getting my letter and getting more products in the future
The site is very easy to navigate and the questions felt that they would give the doctor enough information to understand why having an ESD for our pet is necessary.
Was absolutely amazed at the speed and responsiveness of the Dr and her adaptability to our needs.  She customized the letters she provided to exactly what we needed for our daughter and Chinchilla.  It's taken a weight off her shoulders as she prepares for college and is now approved by her school to move in her ESA.  Thank you!
Hopefully this will be good for Jet Blue who has been very vicious in the past even when my medical doctor gave me a letter. I cannot really comment on how the letter and pass work until I have to fly so I will update you once that occurs
Great Experience!! My ESA letter was provided in a timely manner as mentioned and requested.
Great service. Smooth quick and straight forward. In depth but not invasive.
so far so good. lets see how things go in the future.  That's what it was when I got it.  I have now received everything and couldn't be happier.
I really appreciate that you go above and beyond for campus housing since I'm a PhD candidate
It was very quick and easy to use. When my apartment prompted for more information i was able to get what I needed just from sending and email. I would highly recommend
So far the process has been simple and reassuring.  But I have not received the ESA letter yet or confirmed that Jet Blue will accept it so I am reserving final accolades until the process is complete!
The forms and questions seem like they were written by someone who cares.
I appreciate my information being private and that this site follows  HIPAA regulations
Satisfied so far. Supplied to current place that we are going to be renting soon.
Very easy I received my letter via email within a couple of hours. It's legit and I am pleased and very satisfied!
great so far a little computer glitch on another order but it's working out fine with great support
It was fast and easy. Just waiting for the results. Robert contacted  me back in very fast response time. I was very appreciative of that.
The service was amazing the wait wasn't long
It was  a remarkably smooth quick application process.  And the airline didn't even blink.  Thank you so much.
The ordering process was super straight-forward! My letter came faster than expected and the quality was perfection! I now feel confident in the process of traveling with my fur baby! When I had a question or professional
Easy experience taking the test and setting everything up. The questions were straight forward nothing to hard or difficult to answer.
I'm so happy I found this site to help me and to make it so easy and affordable.
Quick and easy process so far! Heard about this website from a friend who used it and had a good experience. I got the PDF right away and the ID cards in the mail only a few days later!
The only thing I don't like is the non-clarification on why the fee jumped from $149 to $244.
Robert was very nice and helpful! Author of letter was quick and helpful. I will recommend and use this service again!
Received a quick callback from Robert who was super knowledgeable personable and helpful.
The phone call I received prior to filling out my exam was extremely helpful and comforting. I really felt like you guys cared and wanted to help me. Thank you!
Quick and easy and the staff was super helpful! They really took care of us!!  5 stars!!!
Thank you for your thoroughness and willingness to email a PDF of my letter. This is going to be life changing for me!
Great experience but I have not received the letter yet.  The price was a little cheaper than other sites
SO EASY!!! BE SURE TO ONLY ORDER ON YOUR COMPUTER!! using your phone WILL cause an issue at time of payment. Make it as EASY as it really is and jump on your computer when ordering. THANKS!!!!
I found after lengthy research on similar sites and products that getesa.com has by far the most simple approach and it was easy to navigate all questions were answered
Great service quick results and works well! I'd highly reccomend this for anyone who lives in an apartment!
user friendly and it was easy. I would recommend you to my lease clients who have pets......since I am a realtor...
Thank you for all your prompt and effective service. Allegiant Air said that our Emotional support evaluation letter was perfect. Our Cairn terrier Seamus was treated very nicely and even served a cup of ice. It would have been very unpleasant to have traveled without him.
Professional letter with documentation which supports the necessity and  immeasurable value my pet provides to the quality of my daily life
very easy to fill out and this will allow me to move forward with the safety of my dog by my side.
I need your assistance flying out tomorrow @ 5pm. Thanks. My dog helps me a lot.
Navigating the website finding what I need easy and quick. Let's see how the rest of the process goes after my evaluation.
Seems good so far. We'll see if my landlord accepts the letter. I thought the exam was a little short? It took less than 10 minutes so that seems a bit odd to really be able to determine if someone really needs an ESA. Hopefully all works out well!
Very simple to navigate site and explain necessity for letter. Waiting on doctor to send letter
Excellent site I really hope this works with getting my animal certified.
I received my letter and ID cards quickly and everyone was so helpful! Thank you!
Easy and quick. You could include however
Thanks for making the process quick and easy and not to personal that was truly appreciated.
I am excited to keep my dog with me after 17 years I thought I had to part with him but because of you guys I get to keep him.
...glad I found your ESA Service.. Communications with client are very Professional...
Just ordered really simple. Hoping this is the help I need. Thank you.
"Great service this a plus  I went to the property manager office and as soon i gave her the letter they did not charge me for the dog and everything went great thanks a lot. very satisfied with getesa.com
VERY EASY THANK YOU.  IF I DO NOT GET DR. APPROVAL
Could not have been happier with the decision to do this. As a college student I'm under a lot of stress constantly and being able to have my cat at my apartment is a great comfort and highly therapeutic - if it weren't for ESA
The purchasing process was simple and very streamlined.  I liked the options to tailor the letters to different airlines.  No other letter service offered that.
I would say so far 5 stars although the transaction just happened so we shall see.
Great service! The letter was extremely professional and direct. Written by a psychologist who was easy to google and verify she has her own website.  I can keep my dog now!
This was super simple and uses the exact same evaluation questions as my doctors
Easy I would like to receive the Hawaiian airlines flt authorization paperwork as well.
So far so good.  It was amazingly simple to complete the form and submit it for review.  As long as the therapist reviews it and the authorization letter gets done in 48 hours I'll be one happy camper!  Thank you so much!
Robert the representative I spoke with but he assured me that the doctors handle the information very professionally and seriously. He made it feel like the text box was talking to a person
The website is very easy to use. I got my letter and card fast the landlord didn't have any issues letting me and my dog stay after showing her the letter.
I couldn't be more thankful for my ESA letter. GetEsa asked direct questions and took my answers into account. It's not some computer generated response it's an actual doctor who listened to what I had to say. Seriously
Fast and easy the doctor was great! Fast response and promptness to my questions and needs!
thank you so much for all your help in getting me a dog to help me cope
Quick and easy process! Now I don't have to worry about relocating or re-homing my pet.
I had technical problems with the assessment form on the website at first but the issue was resolved. I was personally emailed by Dr. Lisa Isaac and I got everything I needed electronically and by mail.
The process so far was quick and simple hopefully the delivery process is just as quick!
Extremely simple and straightforward. I would definitely recommend again
Completing the form helped me realize how much I depend on the pets and how important it is for companion animals to be with their owners
The website was easy to use and they were quick to respond.  I received my letter in a few days. This is going to make flying with my little dog so much easier.  Thank you.
So thankful to have my companion travel alongside with me. Thank you so much!
Quick and easy very responsive to emailed questions in a timely manor.
This service is great and truly helped me and my cat stay living together for less than an expensive pet fee for my rental home..the landlord approved the letter. I can't thank yall enough for the service. Thank you thank you!!
So far this seems like an easy and non-invasive way to get a medical professional to help me with the ESA prescription. It's not unlike going to a different pharmacy or other service when I need something that my doctor cannot provide. I'm hoping I am able to get my dog qualified as an ESA immediately. He is in Therapy Dog training and we would like to pursue Service Dog training as well.
I just purchased  ESA  letters for my 2 dogs. I will let you know how it goes....I have received the letters and the id cards I haven't used them yet but it has given me peace of mind for the future. the process was easy and the cost compared to other sites was very good.
You have made it very easy for me which makes me feel more at easy. It is really nice knowing there are people our there like you to help.
I appreciate people like you who have found a way to provide services that consumers really need at fair prices. Thank you so much. You don't know how great an impact you've had on my life.
So far so good. I received a timely response to a question I had. Very easy to use this site compared to others.
It was so painless to do and very to the point. I would highly recommended this for people that are needing an emotional support animal.
Received a very fast response time! Your website is easy to use and your prices are fair. Thanks
I just submitted the form if my request is accepted I will be very satisfied and will definitely recommend this site to others.
This is before I receive the product  I hope I as good as the service!
So far so good I can't be 100% without having used my ESA letter. However
Just want to say this was so easy and I'm on my way to being a happier pet parant ! Thank you
"Quick and easy; I appreciate the fact that it is a 7 days a week, 365 days a year service."
very easy steps, fast delivery and very helpful answering my questions. Thank you so much!
It was very self explanatory the site was easy to navigate and the manual exam was very thorough about what your disorders and symptoms where like. Overall a very great and helpful site.
Like that you have option for multiple pets as well as expedited option .
So far so good. Just waiting for letter to come via email
I was skeptical because some websites claim to be authentic but can land you in serious legal troubles if they turn out to be a fraud. This one is authentic thankfully. The best part is the price you get registration AND the letter which is almost a hundred dollars more in total anywhere else as most MDs will charge for the letter. I selected rushed service and I was approved within two hours. Would recommend.,,,,,
So far no complaints. I like the sounds of this company and what it offers.
I am waiting for this to go through. Only then will it be logical to write a proper critique.
Everything so far has gone smoothly. I would  order products from them again.
Thank you so much for your fast assistance. I was extremely stressed and anxious about not having my dog with me when I move and travel and your service has really lifted a huge burden.
I will reassess services once I have completed the process and receive my EMS letters
So far everything is great still havent been approved and hope a quick letter is issued.
The website made it easy to complete the appropriate forms. I have not completed the process yet so I cannot comment on how quick the response is.
it seems to be a really smooth process. looking forward to receiving the letter in my inbox.
Everyone was superb.  The ID did not arrive in time for travel.  Instead Robert provided a copy for printing.  That worked.
This website was extremely easy and helpful and also gave a great amount of information that I needed!
I am very satisfied with how easy and inexpensive this process was and they got back to me very quickly. Overall experience was excellent I definitely recommend this site!
very easy and quick! I needed additional paperwork for my landlord and the doctor had everything done for me so quick. I reached out to the customer service number and they were so kind and helpful with all my questions and concerns. I highly recommend.
I found the questions to be very thought-provoking and thorough. I hope that this service works well and provides me the emotional support animal that I'm looking for.
I felt it was a thorough evaluation and I'm pleased  with the professionalism of the website. It was also a quick and easy experience.
excellent and very quick reply. The approval letter satisfied requirements for HOA.
Everything has been so simple so far I am a little skeptical and would like to follow up with someone after receiving the product!
Than you so very much for making the process pain free and quick. I am so happy to be able to keep my little guy by my side - right where I need him to be.
I don't have the response yet but the form is very accurate in detailing why it is you need your pet
Easy process...had contacted customer service for questions prior and did research.  Seems legitimate!
It's been great so far.  I am very excited to move forward in this process.
This workflow was easy and professional. I used to work in mental health and these were accurate verification questions
Quick and easy! I like the all-in-one option where you can get the ESA travel and housing letters together.
Get Esa was recommended by a friend and I recieved exceptionally  friendly support from all the staff very quick to return emails with my concerns or questions
very easy and this helped me tremendously. This has been a life saver for me. Took a big burden of worry off my shoulders.
So far the experience has been great hoping for a great ending as well.
if is as easy as this and receive my request many more people will be shopping... many
This is an amazing site. I feel that they truly care for you and your needs. Customer support is always readily available for any out of the blue needs. I would highly recommend this site to anyone with actual need for an ESA!
Easy forms with detailed instructions/explanations. Fast and accurate information contained in the reports. They stand behind their word.
Good so far! Hope my letter comes quickly and is accepted by my university!
I was afraid I would feel silly expressing my anxiety but doing it in writing made the experience less daunting.
so grateful to find this site! The doctors truly care and want to help you. I had further questions and emailed the doctor and she emailed back within a day and was so sweet! I will recommend to everyone!
So far it's been easy I usually get it from my Dr. However she's not available to me right now
Everything was efficient and I received my letter in less than 24 hours after the evaluation.
Thank you for your service and help this is such a blessing to have your help with all of this.
The form was easy to fill out and the website is very user friendly as it should be.
My friend Julia Cooper she purchased it for me.  Thank you for making our lives simpler.
Extremely simple. I loved the process and feel like I received everything I needed with ease.
The system is easy to use. It will be a couple days till I know how the rest of this company works. But so far I have loved it.
"So far so good.  Just applied hopefully all goes well
Update: got my letter very quick!"
Very easy to complete details to determine qualification.  I have not taken my trip yet but have submitted the documents to the airline.  More to follow.
I  had to use adifferent computer to execute the order....otherwise a good experience
Wonder quick and easy recommending to friends who struggle with the same problem with their apartments not letting them have ESA pets
Don't know yet.  May be ok.  We'll see if the apartment complex allows it.
I youth it was very easy and gave the correct information needed to order
So far so good but I would like to finish out the process and see how it works
Simple price was right and just amazing. This will help my husband and his brain injury so much
Easy to use. I feel better already knowing my emotional support animal will be able to accompany me.
Process was quick and simple and I was about to receive my letter and identification card in the mail in a week's time. Couldn't ask for more.
Easy to navigate easy to submit
"My ratings only apply to the ""shopping experience"".  This is not an endorsement of the final product.  Time will tell. As a follow-up to my first response, my information was treated with respect, honesty, the product provided was delivered quickly and as advertised.  I recommend."
Application process was easy & price was reasonable compared to other providers. Received the letter same day via email and hardcopy arrived 2 days later. I verified the license of my therapist as well to make sure it was legitimate. I would highly recommend.
This was fast and easy. Avoided me a visit to my psychiatrist. The fees and wait times to see most specialty physicians are ridiculous.
THANK YOU!!! tHIS IS SO IMPORTANT.  i KNOW PEOPLE SCAM ALL THE TIME BUT YOU HAVE HELPED US WHO REALLY NEED THIS.
So far great exalt customer service  have not gotten a response yet great service
So far the website was very easy to use. I am looking forward to hearing back from the doctor and receiving the necessary documents for my pet.
I won't know until the experience is over. It worked just perfect. Thank you
GetEsa.com was very helpful. They were the cheapest company and accommodated my needs for four pets. They responded to inquiries very quickly and I got my letter the same day I applied for it. I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs an emotional support animal. I will be using them again when I need to update my letter.
So far got quick replies to questions.  All answers said this is a legal document.  Sent copy to Allegiant Air and they said: note is compliant to DOT regulation 14 CFR 382.117.   You will still need to present the note on the day of travel at the airport however
When messaging the online chat with questions they helped with every question I've had. Thank you so much !
Has been easy so far. Will have to wait until approved and receive ESA letter to really verify
I loved the experience. It was quick and easy and provided me with everything I needed!
Easy and professional. Fast delivery via email. Town around was less than 24 hours.
The process seemed easy.  I would like a follow up to let you know how it all went.
I hope this will help me find an apartment who will let us stay together.
So easy and concise...and seemingly kinder than other companies offering the same service.
Haven't received the letter yet but the process seemed to have more substance than other similar websites. Pricing was as fair or less than most websites.
The gentleman on the phone was very patient friendly and helpful.  Please call me to receive pymt asap. Thank you!
I found the whole process easy and painless.  Directions were very clear and easy to follow.  I am so grateful for this website!!!
Easy process to go through love the option to receive letter through email.
By far this was the best  website very professional very helpful the process was extremely easy and fast
So the process has been pretty easy. If everything turns out the way I hope well I will be very happy with the site.
Process was straight forward.  I look forward to receiving status. Thanks
The website was so easy to navigate and the questionnaire was very straight-forward. I will be back if I ever need further documentation.
User friendly format. Great friendly staff to assist me by phone for questions. I really like the aspect of free yearly renewals. This is the only place that offers that service! I have already recommended this place to my niece. It arrived really fast! Love this place!
Went well only issue is I can't see the photo I uploaded and Im concerned it didn't  work
Customer Care Associates pleasant to work with very helpful in answering questions and concerns. Emails quickly answered.
Customer Service associates are awesome great communication on the phone and via email.
Excellent Customer Service! Very friendly staff and extremely helpful! Recommend 100%!
So far I am pleased. Looking forward to hearing back from the Psychologist.

So far so good! Just waiting to see the letter...but the process was quick and easy.
So far so good. Easy form to fill out. GREAT questionnaire. I hope I get approved.
Fast and efficient.  Looking forward to receiving my documents in a timely manner.
Was wonderful. Very straightforward from the beginning. Super fast correspondence and very accommodating customer service. Purchased additional verification as my landlord needed papers filled out and was incredibly prompt with delivery. Great service for someone like me who couldn't get in to see my GP before moving.
I provided an invalid shipping address for ID cards and ESA letter I had ordered. The customer service response was incredibly fast and express shipped new copiesof my items to proper address at no additional cost to me. I was very pleased with the service I received here and will be using their services again in the future.
Thank you for providing a simple user-friendly way to register for ESA. Received letter from doctor in 24hours. Thank you getesa.com!!
Great experience! Product just as promised... Extremely friendly and helpful customer service. Would gladly recommend highly.
Relatively straightforward questions and informative website.  Thank you.
It was pretty simple and fast to do the online questionnaire.  The customer service answers any question you have in a timely manner.
The service was great! I ordered the expidited ESA letter and received it very quickly. My landlord is very difficult and called the doctor to verify. They have done a great job verifying for them and keeping me informed throughout the process. Great job! Couldn't be more satisfied.
The process is very simple and I'm very excited to receive my letter and ID card and be able to keep my best friend!
FANTASTIC customer service absolutely phenomenal help.  I really appreciate the timely responses and kindness I've been shown.
So far no complaints the final test will be if this letter solves my problem at my apartment complex
Very quick service. The online chat feature helped me navigate the site.
Very easy to navigate. I am happy with my experience with Get Esa so for.
As long as my dog is able to fly with me I'll be totally happy with my purchase
Easy to work with thank you! I highly recommend this service for anyone who uses their animal(s) as emotional support.
I hope I did it correct!!! I didn't put my CC in yet! I hope it won't slow down the process!!!
Your staff is amazing!!! Thank you so much for your help!!! This is such a great site & sooo amazing for people that depend on their animals for emotional support!!!
So far so good! Emailed customer support about a question and they returned email within a couple of hours same night. Waiting for approval of ESA letter.
It was quick and easy. Had trouble with downloading photo so had to email it. Quick help with that as well!
If this letter gets my dog on the plane from Las Vegas to Des Moines I will be buying the rest of the packages you have to offer and I will recommend this site to everyone I know with a dog!
The process was quick and easy so far but I have not yet received my paperwork. The customer service support was very helpful with answering my questions. I still need to have my interview.
The survey questions mirrored those my doctor would ask about depression symptoms boosting my confidence in the process. It was quick and easy to get through.
I really appreciated the chat session and quick response of Brenda as my situation is unique
So far everything has been great! Now I'm just waiting for the letter and certificate!
My response was quick and concise. I even had to change an order detail and my physician helped with that in a timely fashion!
This process was very easy and I am 100% satisfied. When I needed to update my animals information it was handled with great care and experience. I would highly recommend getesa.com
Was so fast and the ESA letter is really perfect with all details that they need to know
Great! Paid for a rush fee and got my letter in 4 hours! Brought my fur baby home the next day :)
Fast and easy process and response was within the same day.  Glad to see this service provided without hassle and a lot of expense.
Very easy to follow instructions and timely response! I received everything I needed!
Excellent and easygreater than Great service fast the most important thing is there was a person to speak to, there was someone to talk to that assuaged my concerns. Very excellent. Beware of the others on the Internet.
"Great!!!! Everything from beginning to end was simply great, and completed in a very timely manner. The professional product was far more
Superior than any other I've tried. The buck stops with getesa.com. Thanks you from Robert"
My husband is a very stressed person and his comfort dog has an amazing way of keeping him calm. Thanks so much for your support
Worked great really simple and my appartments didn't have any issues so it was worth it.
This was wonderful and an eye opener as I filled out the medical questions. I suffer from panic attacks and having my ESA with me as I travel bus, is essential for me to get through the anxiety. And my husband suffers from claustrophobia, sometimes it isn't so great to get old. This is a valuable service to those of us who have trouble just getting to a Doctor. Thank you for your help!
The service was very fast. Listed time to hear something back was up to 72 hours. I was APPROVED in less than 5. I am so happy that my lovable companion cam stay with me anywhere. Thank you so much getesa.com.
So far it seems to be a reasonable process.   I will update when this process is over
I am very happy with the prompt service I received from getesa.com. I would highly recommend their service. Thank You
Was quick and easy I found this site to be much less than most the others online. The response time was very quick and I receive everything as described.
Easy to purchase.  Could say more if I already had it and had a chance to see how it works.
Very quick service and I even got to talk to a real person about whatever concerns I had regarding ny letter! I will be back to get an air travel letter in the future!
I called and got some clarification that helped me feel confident about using there services
My school won't accept my psychiatrist's letter because it wasn't specific enough. This service makes it quick and easy to get letter.
excellent so far. I just wish you also sold a vest along with the card and tags and letter.
clear questions easy process
This was a quick easy
Robert at extension 700 was friendly and very informative. Excellent customer service!
It was quick and easy! A thorough survey about my current doctor and health seemed to really understand how I feel daily and how an animal would help. The product is very generic but gets the job done I suppose.
Website is a slightly confusing. All of it is on one page instead of loading different pages so you have to scroll. Other than that the workflow was easy to follow.
I found the website very user friendly but I would recommend simply options for the certificate the ID card and the airline certificate descriptions etc
The photo I submitted did not upload after waiting over an hour.  I finally gave up and submitted without the upload!
Site a little difficult to navigate. Perhaps due to my using iPhone instead as my laptop isn’t working
It was nice and easy process. Very organize and really fast to complete.
This website is easy to navigate and understand. My experience was quick and I didn't have any problems.
If you guys can set up a customer account registration that will be much easier for future shopping
I was surprised I had to pay for an update to the pet information in an existing letter - needs to be clearer for future clients.
"I like the all in one form. However, I wish there was a seperate store page or bottom option section for additional items. Either additional items, collars, extra ID cards, etc... Or at least more specific item descriptions.
I was not sure if they ESA Letter was/is the same payment for the Doctor Eval of my submission or if it was just covering the amount of the certificate."
It was an easy process but it did take me a bit to find the cost on the web site
Very informative and easy to use. Quick save buttons along the way would help as I had to restart several times.
I found it a bit difficult at times especially watching the number of characters in a  comment without going over.
I wished there was a # I could speak to directly  since I have no idea which form is needed for housing
I hope I am not scammed because I am in severe need of a letter for my new apartment. Other than that I had no problem filling out the questionnaire.
As long as i get what i need to keep my dog with me then I will be happy.
I need to see if and when I get the letter.  It's been a little difficult to navigate through the system
Questions were easy to answer. I feel satisfied with with my experience.
I'm nervous that this is not a legitimate service.  Please be sure items are stamped showing that my dog is registered with recognized government ESA organization.  Thank you.
so far ok need to see final result and get my dog before full review can be even close to accurate.
My only criticism is more so probably error on my end. I kept on having to redo the entire form every time I was away or minimized it.
I would have liked it better if you were using encryption for security.  Your form is wide open security wise.  I was uncomfortable using my credit card.
I love the detailed questions and the BBB Rating! I have looked at other options and this seemed like the best fit for me.
Once I entered previous ID # most information should self populate and it does not.
has been easy to use and appears streamlined waiting on papers to determine turn around time.
I found the mailing option somewhat confusing.  It's shameful you charge extra to have the new Allegiant form filled out. Your charge was only $49 last year but this year it is $59 plus $10 form fee.
I couldn’t find any reputable counselors locally who didn’t want $1000+ or more to give me a letter and 3 months evaluation even with medical documentation to back up what I have so I did a google search and came upon this company to save me from having to find another home for Savannah and me.
I really appreciate how quickly ESA.com processes your request for you.
"Expeditious service and care coordination. However, I would like privacy. The label clearly states the nature of the package contents, and alludes to psychiatric care and intervention. That is a violation of privacy. My mail carrier should not know my personal health status or concerns. HIPAA.
Please exercise better discretion when sending these packages to patients. EPS on the label would suffice."
Reasonable quick and transparent. A lot of sites try to trick you which is highly annoying and makes me click off their site because I don't feel that I can trust them to not pull something shady with access to my credit information
This service is a godsend. My dog is my child and acts as a life saver due to my severe anxiety and depression. This helps me tremendously as it allows her to stay with me as I don't have health insurance and can't afford to see a doctor at the moment.
I am seriously having anxiety over using this sight even though it came highly recommended.  I pray this is not fake.  On the other-hand the process was very easy.
I called and left a message with regard to my inquiries. I received a call back the next day and a voicemail was left.  However he still answered my questions. I have completed step 1 of process. An instant text message went to my phone confirming order and informing me a doctor assigned to me will be reviewing exam soon
"It went pretty well, but I hope what I paid for will for sure give me free stays at hotels or motels on the road.  This is very important!"
"Self-explanatory questions, however some made you really dig deep. Overall, a really good experience."
So far it was easy but I cannot completely review until the form is sent and airline reviews for acceptability.
I am satisfied with my order at this point as long as I receive my letter for my cat
Simple questionnaire cheaper that the other sites I looked at. Option for only the housing letter was nice. My experience was good and now I have my kitties without worrying about fees or eviction!
I’m a little worried about being charged more then once because my form wouldn’t submit
Easy to use and understand. No rush feeling and the ability to save and go back to complete is very helpful.
Very good. Disappointed that you do not offer an instant online printable report. I am waiting to see how long it takes on your 6 to 12 hour turn around.
Experience was fine. Consider having clients create an online profile and use a portal where our doctors info ESA letters
I really appreciate your services although it took me more like an hour than 10 minutes to get the application filled out.
Its fast! Cheap! And great. It helps alot! I dont have to go out my way
Looking forward to JetBlue form filled out - and hopefully my mom will not have a problem travelling with support dog.
Informative and easy to use website.  Quick response and accommodating customer support.
The price was high but well worth it. I felt comfortable talking about my problem.
Easy and understanding of the true need for a ESA. I do wish since I selected need ASAP that it wasn't a 12 hour wait.
The GetESA website has a lot of great information is very easy to use.
I had issues submitting on the original site and customer service was very helpful in providing me an alternative solution.
More clarification on the process since payment is asked for prior to confirmation would be great! Customer service was able to answer my questions greatly appreciated!
The shopping experience was good for the price and I was able to get my letter soon. Thanks.
It’s a very helpful site.  All that was missing from the site was an application for an ESA housing letter.
This was a bit confusing trying to figure out what I needed in order to renew the ESA letter. I'm still unsure if I purchased the necessary documentation
It was an easy form to fill out. Some of the questions were difficult to understand at the end but all in all it was satisfactory.
"I was little apprehensive about the legitimacy of this young company with all the bad things I read on line and so I emailed them and they responded immediately explaining the process.  With that I went ahead and made a purchase of an ESA letter for air travel.  The next day I received a response with an attached letter by a doctor in Hawaii.  Again, I was a little apprehensive so I called the doctor and he answered on the first try.  He was a retired radiologist, a nice person, now working for emotional support.  We had a nice conversation and he assured me that they never had a letter rejected by the airlines.  I considered this call my first therapy session.  My original letter and dog ID badge came a few days letter by mail.  I plan to travel next month and test the letter with the airlines.  More updates to come.
Regarding the purchasing experience, there were a few glitches in the website, namely my billing address street number and name wasn't showing correctly in the summary page so I added the same address again for shipping to ensure that the information was correct.  Also, each time I went back to change information the State box kept defaulting to armed services.  Other than that, the order was processed efficiently."
Not to extensive and appreciate the fact that a doctor will review my information. Have not taken my flight yet. But did happen to notice that it is a licensed social worker not a physician.
I liked the ease of use but the electronic signature was tricky. I may have more to say once I get some responses and the document itself but so far it has been nice. Like that it is BBB recognized.
The form was not difficult to fill out. I hope it works so I can visit my daughter 2000 miles away.
Very easy to understand. Not too much going on with page to confuse someone.
I didn’t get to finish entering mailing address and the co formation message cut Me off.
Great experience with the application. Looking forward to see my results
It was really easy and made the whole complicated experience of getting a letter much better for me!
Everything was easy to understand. I hope it helps me keep my furry loved ones. I don't know what I'd do without them.
I have not been approved or informed of denial as of now but the process was very easy and I recommend it to people who actually have issues with their mental/emotional health.
"I am still awaiting the arrival of my ESA Letters, and I will do a follow-up review when I receive them.
UPDATE: I received the ESA Letters, and my Delta Form in the mail, and I was pleasantly surprised to receive them on Doctor's Letterhead, on custom paper. Professional and appropriate. When I have a need to renew my ESA Letters, I will be returning as a repeat customer."
Very easy and user friendly. Well done but a little unsure if any further documentation is required at any step.
Easy to use but also thorough with the information. I also like how the airline form options are already included to make the process easier down the line as well.
Just buy it when I receive it and everything is correct I will write a feedback. Thanks
ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SITE. and the staff. Always so polite & efficient. I would suggest them to anyone who needs an emotional support pet. I would simply die without my Buddy.
I read reviews and even checked out the BBB to ensure validity. I think it would be nice to offer a military/veteran discount as well. Granted I found a 10% coupon. Everything was upfront and very well put together. Thank you.
I’m hoping this is legit and I will wait and see to leave a better review.
It's been fine. I got confused a few times and had to redo the questionnaire because I missed the tick mark for only housing. It would be nice if we could go back from the payment screen and edit.
Very responsive so far. Just hoping to get an email copy of these forms since I plan to fly out tomorrow and I won't receive the mailed forms in time before my flight. Thanks!!
I was actually recommend to this site by a coworker. Although it was kind of expensive I liked my experience.
I don't like how vague the renewal process seems.  Make it a little more personalized.
Having never done something like this before I found it easy to follow and timely.
"The price was descent, $89 and change with a coupon for just the housing letter. The service took less than a couple hours from payment to approval and receiving the digital form and I didn't pay for any rush processing or anything. I'm only slightly concerned about the validity of the ESA letter for housing purposes as it was signed off by a radiologist licenced in Hawaii when I'm living in Utah. It's slightly disconcerting..."
The process was easy and extremely quick.  I was approved and emailed copies of my letter within hours of completion.  However the website wasn't clear about the Travel ID Cards.  I couldn't find any information about that.  Thankfully
The service was very easy and fast. It got to the point and I appreciate that a lot these days
Easy shopping experience - no one called me to confirm but i got the letter immediately. There is a news article about how this particular doctor is a scam though. Not sure how that will be useful once the landlord googles the name.
Quick and easy for the most part. Hopefully the results are as good as the shopping experience.
I had a good shopping exp. But I feel that it was kinda sketchy because I couldn't find good information about how reliable and certified this site is so I was skeptical
Great website easy to use and all questions where mostly answered on the site.
I hope this senses me to get my pet at last. Sure would help with the loneliness
So far its been okay will update when I get everything and try to use the letter.
I get that this is technically a loophole and im fine with that nor am i paying some exorbitant amount of money so he can live with me.
It was a good experience. Stressful to write my personal history. But professional.
Online was easy but i wont know if i got what i needed until i see the letters
I have never done anything like this online so it was a little unusual but the site made it very easy to understand and get through the process.  I received a very quick response which was greatly needed in my circumstance. Thank you.
Quick turn around. Thank you so much for getting me my papers on time and efficiently.
I had trouble with the form evertime I saved it
It’s fine. To the point and straight forward. The prices just need to be stated upfront such as what a fast review will cost.
I can't really give 5 stars until I receive all the info in the mail. So far its been straightforward with fantastic pricing and clear instructions.
This was easy to navigate and very straight forward. I ordered the ID card and the picture is not good. It was probably partly the picture I submitted but she's blue and orange. It will do the trick though
Finished the form and now I am waiting to hear back from them! hopefully they get back to me soon so that I know if I can bring my dog with me.
Fast and easy. The letter lists the website at the bottom which I hope is not going to be a problem with the airline b
Things worked will update if the product is not delivered as described.
things have been easy thus far. but i am anxious to see the end results.
So far i've enjoyed this website. I was referred by a co-worker so I hope this website is legit.
My experience so far has been very smooth.  Let's see how it goes from here on in.
It was easy and quick....just hope it works for my dog so we can travel with him.
It was simple and to the point however slightly confusing when it came to delivery options/add-on expenses
quick and easy would suggest ability to print receipt when paying.  I also need a link email pic of dog for id.
Just waiting to see if the letter is quality and from a licensed MD or Therapist
I hope this is valid and won't cause me any problems when I show it as proof of need for an ESA at my apartment complex.
Thank you for the call back.  I don't understand why the saved file wasn't able to be retrieved and I had to put in everything again.
So far everything has been smooth and easy
The survey was a little too long for me but overall i feel very satisfied.
Overall very good experience but cannot confirm until I know what the outcome is
I hope this is a secure and safe site and is legit. Overall it was fast and easy
It was fine the test just doesn't accommodate someone that is not capable to fill this out.
The payment page does not itemize what makes up the total cost which is confusing because I have two pets. I need to make sure each of them has his own ID card and letter.
I am hoping that this is a valid site for TSA/flying I cannot make a full assessment until I take the letter to the airport along with the DD214 and disabled discharge paperwork
Good so far.  Was treated well and everything went through very quickly.
customer service response very quick which is good but so far I just paid the money so will see
Good customer service. Very responsive to questions/concerns of customers.
It was pleasant I'm excited for my pet to be a certified emotional  support animal.
I dont know until I receive my letterHopefully it will be stisfactory and I will tell others to  go here for help.thank you Sheila
The form was easy to fill out the only problem I had is that you could only claim 3 pets (I have 4)
I appreciate that there's a rush option and airline specific forms.  Thanks!
was a fast and easy experience. hopefully all goes smoothly for my college letter
I am thoroughly peased with the eas and thoroughness of my experience. Now I hope to see the letter works without a hitch.
Kept getting  locked on the submit form. Website would not  recognize that everything had been filled out
The website was easy to navigate unsure about my complete review until I actually get my letter
This was a good experience. I just need to know how do I get the pictures to you. Thanks!
We have submitted 6 times but never got this far
With only a few glitches..it was a decent site. I will write a more informative review after i recieve my letter and am able to keep my baby in my new apartment.
Quick effeciant. Hopefully gwt approved so my pet doesn't have to leave.
I wish there were a section to fill out what you have already been diagnosed with. Also it's tricky to pick a weight range for a cat since the options are 0-10 and 11-20
It was easy to register and apply for the animal housing letter.  I hope all the rest goes as smoothly.  Thank you.
I did not see where to upload a photo of my dog for the id card that I paid for.
Very helpful and very quick I hope I can get my letter as soon as possible
Had to retype everything a couple of times...doesn't save info if you advance....
Simple and easy to understand. Extremely prompt reply.  Could not be more pleased with your service. Thank you.
It was easy but I would like to see the final outcome and if everything falls through with my dog and flight
I had some questions that did not get answered via chat.. I wanted to know if I will need an airline specific letter i.e. American later in the year can I have that added on to my order? Also is there a discount for coming back next year?
The experience was good.  I can give a better rating once I receive the letter
I just had to refill my info since the back button did not work in check out stage.
Everything was great except the signature because if you try to erase the signature to do it again the system deletes everything.
It was super easy I loved that it explains everything where you can understand it
It was easy. Its good to write down your experiences and feelings knowing a professional looks at it. It is a weird but good for of therapy in itself.
I can't really comment on anything because I have not gotten a letter back.  I can say more once I receive it and it is approved by the housing.
the buying process is simple but would like to see a sample letter ahead so that I can know it meets the requirements for the airline
Had to submit a few times so this was first rating but otherwise I liked my experience
I hope I can bring an emotional support dog into my home with a esa letter.
Was extremely happy with how fast everything was done. Had our letters within 24 hrs. Which was perfect because we already had a new ESA dog. Thanks so much.
So far so good but will reserve comments after letter is received and accepted for living in an apartment.
How can i say how good your service is when i havent gotten my documents yet ?
Seems quick and easy and I checked to make sure they are licensed and they are
Easy to use and extremely satisfied with the amount of time it took to get my letter
Seems quick and easy.  A little more info about what to expect or sample of letter to be received would be helpful
It was good I just had a problem because my gmail account was not correct that i sent so i am using my wives
Too soon to tell if this is legit seemed too simple. Hope I'm not getting ripped off.
I just could not find the phone number until i completed the application. I had a question to ask...Hopefully you will be contacting me via email and we will make any necessary corrections. Thanks
I was unable to complete this on my phone and had to use my IPad with wifi connection
Seems good so far.  I got kicked out of the sight once right at the end so had to start over and had a hard time with the system accepting my email address
Haven't received anything yet  website was easy to use and easy to understand. Great options
so far so good. I just hope that its a legitimate letter with all the necessary elements needed for both airline and landlord
It says if you would like to save and continue later click and link will be sent to you email. NEVER RECEIVED LINK. Also contacted support before adding payment info because it mentions credit card like I'd tag with a picture of MY dog. That option IS NEVER MENTIONED WHEN ORDERING. Corrected problem through customer service.
I cannot fully rate and review this as of yet because I have only just purchased my letter and submitted the exam.  So based on everything thus far
We just got our new address for Georgia. Could someone get ahold of me so I can get my information updated. Thank you
It was very quick and easy!  just kept having trouble with the internet here so took a little longer to fill out!!
Whenever I got stuck with sending it the answer was just a phone call away. Very helpful.
The representative that called me was extremely helpful and informative.
So far so good the experience has been quick easy and smooth would recommend
Very easy but lost info on form when I went back to review my email was correct. Second try was a charm!
Everything was pretty straight forward but I'm not sure if the form saved.
Everything seems to be going well so far I haven't received the letter yet
So far this has been a very responsive program.  I like that a experienced psychologist reviews information before a decision is made regarding an emotional support animal prescription
"I had requested a letter for Hawaiian airlines, but have not received! Otherwise"
Had a small glitch with technology called and was walked through the process. Thank you for the great customer service!
It all went off well except for uploading the picture. I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working but your customer service rep Sarah
I had problems trying to use different billing and shipping addresses.  When going to the previous page changes I had made would revert and I would have to redo the changes.  I spent considerable time trying to get the transaction to go through with no messages displayed to indicate what the problem was.  Now but I had to use my card as that was the only way it would go through.  :(
It has been pretty simple so far.  I will have a better idea when the service is completed.
Im not sure how this is going to go. Id like to answer these questions when I get to my destination
couldnt renew mine from you guys same time last year
New format ...wish there were a few more instructions.  Checked no mail necessary and still charged me $10.  Also was not sure which airline to choose. Hope I can get that later.
Everything was very simple but thorough. I feel confident in this site.
I didnt understand how the process is. Is the letter will have the stamp? I will like to now if i will received an ID of my dog.
I was disappointed that I need a special form for each airline. Not your fault but the older I get the harder it is.  Fixed incomes not fun to deal with. Again not your problem.
I haven't actually received anything. So I'm still unsure about the service.
Why doesn't my address show?  I've tried three separate times - if you cannot track my address how can you mail me a letter?
The site was easy to use but wouldn’t accept the credit card I wanted to use.
I am not sure yet. I completed everything last night and still have received no email call
I was not told the physician would be out of state. The apartment I wanted to rent questioned the letter due to the physician being so far away. I wish this would have been more transparent in the description prior to purchase. Otherwise everything else was wonderful.
Details section is really hard to type into and u can’t copy and save. Too easy to lose info already typed
Not sure what to say as of yet. I used a different sight last time and had guaranteed lawyer help which was a HELPFUL thing. If I have any issues i will certainly contact you!
Living with a TBI is not easy. I've heard that we do not pick a cat; they pick us. My cat and I are best(est) buds. It is very reassuring that I have protected our bond with the ESA ID and documentation.
The price is the best I have found plus it was the only place that would add a second animal without having to have a completely separate letter.
Its a little confusing and hard to understand when you ask the same question 100 times
I felt the extra charges that keep popping up make me irritated.  I'm not sure why I pay 10 extra $ for a letter.
Good service but the website is hard to follow and needs updating. It is sometimes confusing and frustrating to not know something cost anything and being surprised when I see it at checkout. Overall a fairy good experience.
I mean I just purchased this hasn't even been a minute so I really can't say how the shopping experience has been... Quick? I guess? I'll let you know if and when I get my letter.
initially says you can instantly print out letter for free during checkout says you have to pay an additional $35 in order to do that
I am giving 3/5 stars because i am reviewing before i receive any feedback from the company
Kind of confusing. It says free exam but I have to pay? I probably wouldn't have paid
Ihave not received the certificate yet will let you know after my problem has been resolved.  Thank you.. Bianca
Wish I knew that I would get 10% off if I took the qualifying examination before I paid full price. Not very happy about that and kind of feel taken advantage of.
Site is very user friendly the satisfaction guarantee is greatly appreciated. Excited to see the result.
i had to keep answering the same questions and then when doing spell check i had to start over
I'm a little nervous.   No one answered the phone for verification regarding this business.
Very quick and easy.  Was recommended by a friend. Had issues with apartment complex as letter received was exact same as friend.  They questioned the legitimacy of the letter.  Gave me their forms to have signed and submitted.  Sent back within a day and no issues bringing back to complex.
I could not upload the picture from my phone. I had to complete on a computer.
It was self explanatory. I'm excited to see if my new landlord excepts it.
This my second attempt to buy this service. I hope I have better luck this time.
I'm interested to see if this will help me. My situation is sort of dire.
I just submitted my application. I have not seen any results. I have to wait to see if it helps my situation.
This was not an accessible letter for the HOA since it was not coming from a real Doctor.  I also did not receive my 20% off from the promotion ESA2018. Please send the money ASAP
I tried to do this before but it did not go through and I had to do everything all over again.
I do not like how the extra prices are not shown. My total is now  $219 but I thought I only had $50 worth of add ons. Because of that I may not recommend depending on if my price is right. I may not buy again if I can not see the individual totals.
Your form would not fill correctly.  My phone # is 602-614-3730. I would input and it showed another prefix and changed the state validation below.  I am in ARIZONA.  10 TIMES. I DON'T KNOW IF IT  TOOK CORRECTLY THIS LAST TIME.
They give you a letter from a therapist that is not licensed in your state. This makes it so your housing company can deny you.
It is not telling me anything I better not get a second charge. Only reason need is her doctor is out of town.
"I paid for the ""reasonable accommodation"" form $20  my initial payment and I just got charged again!"
Irvine Company does not accept letters from this company. Money down the drain.
The form they sent looks like something I could have made myself and it says it's issued by the State of California when I live in Utah. I tried contacting them for a refund and you can't even talk to a person or leave an actual message.
I paid extra money to get my stuff the next day it hasn't shown and it's been four days now I'm not happy at all you guys ripped me off when I could of just went standard and got it at the same time and not have to pay 30 dollars for both things not cool and won't go throw you guys again
Very easy process and I am confident it is official. They actually call you with a therapist in your area and make sure all your needs are met.
So far so good. Can't wait to see how the rest of my experience is. It was great very easy yet informative.
Your company helps those that do not know how to get over the hurdles of travelling and living peacefully with their pets...I am grateful.
So far everything has went smoothly. Hoping my apartment accepts. Everything has been super fast and simple!
I love the face that I don't have to worry anymore about leaving my only security
Very easy process and also affordable way to make my pet an official emotional support animal.
awesome company. great customer service who guided me through everything. I spoke to Julia. I got my esa documents to fly the same day. They even do a customized letter from delta documents which they filled out for me. I recommend for anyone needing to live with an esa dog or fly with one.
thank you so much for helping me with my situation. My Dog has been helping get through things in life. THANK YOU!
it has been such a relieve to be able to find people like you willing to help people like me
Counselor called exactly as scheduled on time. Conversation was relatively painless. It brought up some emotions
GetEsa is so quick and easy. They understand how we feel and how much we need our dog around us to feel comfortable. Thank you so much Get Esa!
So far it was easy. I will be happy as long as I get a letter signed by a licensed therapist in my state.
Easy and clear info They guided me step by step through the process
Getesa answered all my questions about certifying my little buddy so I can have her with me when I travel by plane. They also have very good reviews
All good except I would have liked a hyperlink that goes directly to the ESA letter renewal.  Thank you!
I'm not one to ask. Myself and my Dads dog Harley. Are upset. I lived with my Dad and Harley for over a year. And I have to say that Harley always was a bright spot in both of our lives. My father died in December and I have back problems.  But he will get me off my butt.
I was a little confused about the timer. I was waiting to be redirected to a clinician but realized I had to buy first
The entire process was Very Simple I was able to get all my things in order so my Pet could accommodate me on my upcoming travel plans . They even helped with further questions
